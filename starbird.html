          For sets $A_1,A_2 \subset X$ show that

          \subset f^{-1}(A) \cup f^{-1}(B)$.
          
          Now suppose $x \in f^{-1}(A) \cup f^{-1}(B)$. 
          Then $f(x) \in A$ or $f(x) \in B$. Then $f(x) \in A \cup B$. It follows 
          $x \in f^{-1}(A \cup B)$. Hence $f^{-1}(A \cup B)

        </div>
        <div class="proof">
          We prove by inducting on $n$. The base case for $n = 1$ is trivially true.
          For the inductive hypothesis assume $P(m)$ is true where $P(m)$ denotes
          the theorem statement for $n = m$. We show $P(m+1)$ is true. Now suppose we 
          a collection of $m+1$ open sets, $\{U_i\}_{i=1}^{m+1}$. By the hypothesis
          it follows $\cap_{i=1}^m U_i$ is open. Since the intersection of two open
          sets is an open set we have $(\cap_{i=1}^m U_i) \cap U_{m+1} \in \tau$. Hence,
          $\cap_{i=1}^{m+1} U_i \in \tau$. This concludes the induction.

          Why does your proof not prove the false statement that the infinite 
          intersection of open sets is necessarily open?
        </div>
        The above proof only shows that a finite intersection is open. Counterexample: 
        consider $\tau_\text{std}$ on $\mathbb{R}$. Then the intersection over the 
        collection $\{I_i\}_{i=1}^n$ where $I_j = (-1/j,1/j)$ is just $\{0\}$. However,
        this is not open. 
        <div class="theorem">
          A set $U$ is open in a topological space $(X,\tau)$ if and only if for 
          every point $x \in U$, there exists an open set $U_x$ such that
          $x \in U_x \subset U$.
        </div>
        <div class="proof">
          For the forward direction take $U_x = U$. For the reverse direction
          consider $\cup_{x \in U} U_x$ and note it is open since it is a union 
          of open sets. We show $U = \cup_{x \in U} U_x$. First we show
          $U \subset \cup_{x \in U} U_x$. Let $p \in U$. Then there exists 
          a corresponding $U_p$. Then $p \in U_p \subset \cup_{x \in U} U_x$.
          Hence, $U \subset \cup_{x \in U} U_x$. Now we show
          $U \supset \cup_{x \in U} U_x$. Let $q \in \cup_{x \in U} U_x$. Then
          $q \in U_x$ for some $x \in U$. Moreover, $U_x \subset U$ for any
          $x$. Hence, $q \in U_x \subset U$. Therefore, 
          $U \supset \cup_{x \in U} U_x$. It follows $U = \cup_{x \in U} U_x$.
          Furthermore, we know the right side is open so then $U$ must also be
          open.

          In $\mathbb{R}^n$, the <strong>Euclidean distance</strong> between

          Moreover, the <stong>standard topology</strong> $\tau_{\text{std}}$ on 
          $\mathbb{R}^n$ is defined as follows: a subset $U$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$
          belongs to $\tau_{\text{std}}$ if and only if for each point $p$ of
          $U$ there is an $\varepsilon_p > 0$ such that $B(p,\varepsilon_p)
          \subset U$.

        <div class="exercise">
          The $\tau_{\text{std}}$ is a topology on $\mathbb{R}^n$.
        </div>
     
        <div class="proof">
          The empty set is open vacuously. For whole set $\mathbb{R}^n$ consider 
          any point $p \in \mathbb{R}^n$. Then we can take the ball $B(p,1)$. Then 
          $p \in B(p,1) \subset \mathbb{R}^n$. It follows the whole set is open.
          Now consider two open sets $U$ and $V$. Consider a point $p$ in their 
          intersection $U \cap V$. Since $U$ and $V$ are open and $p \in U$ and
          $p \in V$ there exists $r_u,r_v > 0$ such that $B(p,r_u) \subset U$ and 
          $B(p,r_v) \subset V$. Take $r = \min\{r_u,r_v\}$. Then $B(p,r) \subset U$
          and $B(p,r)\subset V$. Hence, $B(p,r) \subset U \cap V$. Now consider a
          collection of open sets $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in \lambda}$. Take a point 
          $p \in \cup_{\alpha \in \lambda} U_\alpha$. 
          Then $p \in U_\beta$ for some $\beta \in \lambda$. Since $U_\beta$ is open we have 
          $p \in B(p,r) \subset \cup_{\alpha \in \lambda} U_\alpha$ for some $r > 0$. 
          Hence, the union over the collection 
          $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in \lambda}$ is open. It follows $\tau_\text{std}$ is a topology.

        <div class="example">
          Given a set $X$, let $\tau = 2^X$, the set of all subsets of $X$. This topology 
          $\tau$ is called the <strong>discrete topology</strong> on $X$. We call the 
          space $(X,2^X)$ a <strong>discrete topological space</strong>. 
        </div>

        <div class="example">
          Given a set $X$, the collection $\tau = \{\varnothing, X\}$ is called the 
          <strong>indiscrete topology</strong> on $X$. We call the space 
          $(X, \{\varnothing,X\})$ an <strong>indiscrete topological space</strong>. 
          In this space, there are only two open sets: the empty set and the entire set 
          $X$.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
          Given a set $X$, the <strong>finite complement</strong> of cofinite topology

          $X-U$ is finite or $U = \varnothing$.

        <div class="example">
          Given a set $X$, the <strong>countable complement</strong> or cocountable topology on $X$ 
          is described as follows: a subset $U$ of $X$ is open if and only if $X-U$ is 
          countable or $U = \varnothing$.

        <div class = "exercise">
          Verify that the discrete, indiscrete, finite complement, and countable complement 
          topologies are indeed topologies for any set $X$.
        </div>
        <div class="proof">
          We first verify the discrete topology. Since every subset of $X$ is open, 
          $\varnothing$ and $X$ itself are open. If $U$ and $V$ are open sets. Then their
          intersection is another subset of $X$. Hence, $U \cap V$ is open. Moreover, an 
          arbitrary union of open sets is a subset of $X$ so then the union must also be 
          open. It follows the discrete topology is in fact a topology.
          <br><br>
          Second we verify the indiscrete topology. By definition $\varnothing$ and $X$ 
          are open. Since these are the only two sets, there is only one intersection to 
          consider, $\varnothing \cap X = \varnothing$. Hence, open sets are closed under 
          intersection. Consider an arbitrary collection of open sets $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in \lambda}$.
          If for all $\alpha \in \lambda$, $U_\alpha = \varnothing$, then the union over
          the collection is $\varnothing$. Otherwise if for some $\alpha \in \lambda$ we have
          $U_\alpha = X$, then the union of the collection is $X$. In either case, the union 
          over the collection is open. It follows the indiscrete topology is indeed a topology.
          <br><br>
          Third, we verify the cofinite topoology. By definition the empty set is open. 
          Since $X - X = \varnothing$ which is finite, it follows $X$ is open. Now consider 
          two open sets $U$ and $V$. Then consider $X - (U \cap V)$. By De Morgan's law 
          we have $(X - U) \cup (X - V)$. We know $X-U$ and $X-V$ are finite and the union 
          of two finite sets is finite. Hence, $U \cap V$ is open. Now consider the arbitrary 
          collection of open sets $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in \lambda}$. Consider $X-\cup_{\alpha \in \lambda} U_\alpha$. 
          This equates to $\cap_{\alpha \in \lambda} (X - U_\alpha)$. We know $X - U_\beta$
          for some $\beta \in \lambda$ is finite and $\cap_{\alpha \in \lambda} (X - U_\alpha) \subset X-\beta$. 
          It follows $\cap_{\alpha \in \lambda} (X - U_\alpha)$ is finite. Hence, the arbitrary 
          collection of open sets is in fact open. Therefore, the confinite topology is a topology.
          <br><br>
          Lastly, we verify the cocountable topology. By definition the empty set is again 
          open. $X-X = \varnothing$ which is finite implying countable. Since the union of 
          two countable sets is countable, it follows if $X-V$ and $X-U$ are countable, their 
          intersection is as well. Consider the arbitrary collection of open sets $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in \lambda}$. 
          Then consider $X - \cup_{\alpha \in \lambda}U_\alpha$. This is equivalent to 
          $\cap_{\alpha \in \lambda} (X-U_\alpha)$. This is at most countable. Hence, the 
          cocountable topology is a topology.

        We construct a case for the cofinite topology on $\mathbb{R}$. 
        For $i \in \mathbb{N}$ define $U_i = \mathbb{R} - \{1,\dots,i\}$. Each of

        \bigcup_{\alpha \in \left[0,1\right)} (\mathbb{R}-U_\alpha) = \left[1,\infty\right)\]

          For any topological space $(X,\tau)$ and $A \subset X$, the set $\overline{A}$ 
          is closed. That is, for any set $A$ in a topological space, $\overline{\overline{A}} = \overline{A}$.

          We show that $\overline{A}$ contains all its limit points. Let $p$ be a limit point 
          of $\overline{A}$. If $p \in A$ then $p \in \overline{A}$. Thus, we assume 
          $p \notin A$. Now to prove $p \in \overline{A}$ it is sufficient to show $p$ is 
          a limit point of $A$ which is what we prove. Since $p$ is a limit point of $\overline{A}$, 
          by definition we have $(U-\{p\}) \cap \overline{A} \ne \varnothing$ for any open 
          neighborhood $U$ of $p$. Let $q$ be in this intersection. There are two cases. If 
          $q \in A$ then we are done. Now consider the case where $q$ is a limit point of $A$.
          Since $U$ is also an open neighborhood of $q$ and $q$ is a limit point of $A$, it follows 
          $(U-\{q\} \cap A \ne \varnothing)$. Note $p$ is not in this intersection since we

          We prove the forward direction first. Let $p \in X-A$. Since $A$ is closed, $p$

          of $p$ such that $U \cap A = \varnothing$. Then $U \subset X-A$. Altogether, we have
          $p \in U \subset X-A$. Hence, by Theorem 2.3 $X-A$ is open. Now we prove the 
          reverse direction. Say $X-A$ is open. We show $A$ is closed. Let $q$ be a limit point 
          of $A$. Then for every open neighborhood $V$ of $q$, $(V-\{q\}) \cap A \ne \varnothing$. 
          For the sake of contradiction suppose $p \in X-A$. Since, $X-A$ is open, there exists 
          some open neighborhood $W$ of $p$ such that $p \in W \subset X-A$. Then 
          $(W-\{p\}) \cap A = \varnothing$. But this contradicts $p$ being a limit point of $A$.

          The complement of this finite union is the finite intersection $\cap_{i=1}^n (X-U_i)$.
          This is a finite intersection of open sets. This is open. Hence, the finite union

          The same argument holds for when $p \in \overline{B}$. Thus $\overline{A} \cup \overline{B} \subset

          We show the cantor set satisfies the criteria above. 
          We construct the cantor set. Let $C_0 = \left[0,1\right]$. 
          Then $C_{n-1}$ consists of $2^n$ closed intervals. For each interval, 
          take out the middle third. Then this is defined to be $C_n$. For example,
          
          \[C_0 = \left[0,1\right] \]
          \[C_1 = \left[0,1/3\right] \cup \left[2/3, 1\right]\]
          \[C_2 = \left[0,1/9\right] \cup \left[2/9,3/9\right] \cup \left[6/9,7/9\right] \cup \left[8/9, 1\right]\]
          Generally we have
          \[C_n = I_n^1 \cup I_n^2 \cup I_n^3 \cup \cdots \cup I_n^{2^n}\]
          
          Where if $j < k$ then $x < y$ for all $x \in I_i^j, y \in I_i^k$ 
          for all $j,k \in \{1,2,3,...,2^i\}$ and all $i \in \mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$. 
          Then the cantor set is defined to be $C = \cap_{i=1}^\infty C_i$. We now show 
          $C$ is a subset of the interval $\left[0,1\right]$, closed, contains no non-empty 
          open interval, and no point of $C$ is an isolated point.

          Since  $\left[0,1\right]  \supset C_0 \supset C_1  \supset \cdots$ it follows $C 
          \subset \left[0,1\right]$. Moreover, $C$ is an infinite intersection of closed 
          sets which is closed by Theorem 2.16. Now we show that $C$ contains no non-empty 
          open interval. For sake of contradiction, suppose that $C$ contains a non-empty open 
          interval $(s,t)$ where $s < t$ and $s,t \in \mathbb{R}$.

          Let $P(n)$ be the statement "Let $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$ and $a < b$. 
          If $(a,b) \subset C_n$ then $|a-b| \leq 1/3^n$ for some non-negative 
          integer $n$." We show that $p(n)$ is true for all $n \geq 0$ by induction. 
          For the base case, consider $n=0$. Then suppose $(a,b) \subset C_0 = 
          \left[0,1\right]$. Then we have $0 \leq a < b \leq 1$. It follows $|a-b| 
          \leq 1 = 1/3^0$. It follows $P(0)$ is true. 

          Now we move on to the inductive step. For the inductive hypothesis 
          we assume $P(m)$ is true. Now assume $(a,b) \subset C_{m+1}$. Since 
          $C_{m+1} \subset C_m$ it follows $(a,b) \subset C_m$. Then $C_m$ has 
          $2^m$ disjoint closed intervals.
          \[C_m = I_m^1 \cup I_m^2 \cup I_m^3 \cup \cdots \cup I_m^{2^m}\]
          where $I_w^z$ is the zth closed interval for $C_w$. It follows $(a,b)$ 
          is in exactly one of these intervals. Then let $(a,b) = I_m^k$ for some 
          $k \in \{1,2,...,2^m\}$. Then $I_m^k=\left[c,d\right]$ where $c,d \in 
          \mathbb{R}$. Since $(a,b)\subset\left[c,d\right]$ we have $c \leq a < b 
          \leq d$. It follows $|a-b|\leq d-c$. For the sake of contradiction 
          suppose $d-c>1/3^m$. Then there exists $p,q\in\mathbb{R}$ such that 
          $(p,q) \subset C_m$ and $|p-q| > 1/3^m$; however, since $(p,q) \subset 
          C_m$ we must have $|p-q| \leq 1/3^m$ by the inductive hypothesis. This 
          is a contradiction. It follows $d-c\leq 1/3^m$. 

          Since $(a,b)\subset \left[c,d\right] \subset C_m$ and by assumption 
          $(a,b)\subset C_{m+1}$, it follows $(a,b)$ falls in the left or right 
          third of $\left[c,d\right]$. Specifically, $(a,b) \subset 
          \left[c,c+\frac{1}{3}(d-c)\right]$ or $(a,b) \subset 
          \left[c+\frac{2}{3}(d-c),d\right]$. Then we have 
          \[c \leq a < b \leq c+\frac{1}{3}(d-c)\]
          or
          \[c + \frac{2}{3}(d-c) \leq a < b \leq d\]
          In either case we have $|a-b| \leq (d-c)/3$. But $d-c \leq 1/3^m$ 
          so then $|a-b| \leq 1/3^{m+1}$. It follows $P(m+1)$ is true. This 
          concludes the induction. Hence, $P(n)$ is true for all $n \geq 0$. 

          We assumed that $(s,t) \subset C$. Then $(s,t) \subset C_m$ for all 
          $m \in \mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$. Since we showed $P(n)$ is true for all 
          $n \in \mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$, it follows $|s-t| \leq 1/3^m$ for all $m$. 
          Suppose $|s-t| > 0$. Then by the archimedean property there exists a 
          sufficiently large $m$ such that $|s-t| > 1/3^m$. It follows $|s-t| = 0$. 
          Moreover $(s,t) \in \left[0,1\right]$ so then $0 < s,t$ which implies $s=t$.
           But this is a contradiction since this implies $(s,t)$ is an empty open 
           interval. Moreover, we assumed $s < t$. Hence, $C$ contains no non-empty 
           open interval.

          Now we show $C$ contains no isolated points. Let $P^*(n)$ be the statement 
          "let $x \in \mathbb{R}$. If $x \in C_n$ there exists $y \in \mathbb{R}$ such 
          that $y\ne x$, $y \in C$, and $|x-y| \leq 1/3^n$ for some non-negative integer
           $n$." We show $P^*(n)$ is true for all non-negative integers. Suppose 
           $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and $x \in C_i$ for some $i \in \mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$.
          Then 
          \[C_i = I_i^1 \cup I_i^2 \cup I_i^3 \cup \cdots \cup I_i^{2^i} \]
          Then $x \in I_i^j$ for some $j \in \{1,2,3,...,2^i\}$. 
          Then $I_i^j = \left[c,d\right]$ where $c,d \in \mathbb{R}$ and $c < d$. 
          Then $c \leq x \leq d$. If $x < d$ then let $y = d$ so then $(x,y) 
          \subset C_i$. Otherwise if $x = d$ then let $y = c$ so then $(y,x) 
          \subset C_i$. In either case, the hypothesis of $P(i)$ (note $P(i)$ 
          not $P^*(i)$) is satisfied so then by the implication of $P(i)$ we have 
          $|x-y| \leq 1/3^i$. Moreover $y \ne x$.

          Now we show $y \in C$. Notice $y =d$ or $y = c$ for $I_i^j$. 
          If suffices to show that if $y$ is an endpoint of some closed 
          interval $I_p^q$ (where $p \in \mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$ and $q \in 
          \{1,2,3,...,2^p\}$), then $y \in C$. 

          Suppose $y$ is an endpoint of some interval in $C_k$ where 
          $k\geq0$. Then 
          \[
          y \in I_k^\ell = \left[c_k^\ell, d_k^\ell \right]
          \]
          for some $\ell \in \{1,2,3,...,2^k\}$ and $c_k^\ell$ and 
          $d_k^\ell$ are the corresponding endpoints. Since $y$ is an 
          endpoint of $I_k^\ell$ we have either $y = c_k^\ell$ or $y = d_k^\ell$.
           If $y = c_k^\ell$ then 
          \[
          y \in I_{k+1}^{2\ell-1} = 
          \left[y,d_{k+1}^{2\ell-1}\right]=\left[y,c_k^\ell+(d_k^\ell-c_k^\ell)/3\right]
          \]
          Then $y = c_{k+1}^{2\ell-1}$. If $y = d_k^\ell$ then 
          \[
          y \in I_{k+1}^{2\ell} = \left[c_{k+1}^{2\ell}, y\right] = 
          \left[c_k^\ell+2(d_k^\ell-c_k^\ell)/3,y\right]
          \]
          Then $y = d_{k+1}^{2\ell}$. It follows $y$ is an endpoint of some interval 
          in $C_{k+1}$. Hence, we have shown if $y$ is an endpoint of some interval
           in $C_k$ then $y$ is an endpoint of some interval in $C_{k+1}$. 

          Recall that we showed that if $x \in C_i$ then there exists $x\ne y \in C_i$
          such $|x-y|\leq 1/3^i$. Moreover, we take $y$ as an endpoint in some closed 
          interval $I_i^j$. It follows $y$ is an endpoint of some interval in $C_i$.
          We have shown that if $y$ is an endpoint of some interval in $C_k$ then $y$
          is an endpoint of some interval in $C_{k+1}$ for all $k\geq 0$. By induction,
          t follows $y$ is an endpoint of $C_m$ and therefore $y \in C_m$ for all 
          $m \geq i$. Moreover, we have $C_0 \supset C_1 \supset \cdots \supset C_i$.
          It follows $y \in C_v$ (but not necessarily an endpoint of) for all 
          $0 \leq v < i$. It follows $y \in C_w$ for all $w \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{0\}$. 
          Thus $y \in C$. It follows $P^*(n)$ is true for all $n \in \mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$.

          Using $P^*(n)$ we show there exists no isolated points in $C$. 
          Let $x \in C$ and suppose we have the open set $U = (x-\epsilon, x+\epsilon)$ 
          where $\epsilon\in\mathbb{R}$ and $\epsilon>0$. Then by the archimedean 
          property there exists a sufficiently large $n \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{0\}$ 
          such that $1/3^n < \epsilon$. Then let $m \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{0\}$ such 
          that $1/3^m < \epsilon$. Since $x \in C$ it follows $x \in C_m$. Then by 
          $P^*(m)$ it follows there exists a $y \in C$ such that $|x-y| \leq 1/3^m < \epsilon$.
           It follows $((x-\epsilon, x+\epsilon) - \{x\}) \cap C \ne \varnothing$ 
           since $y \in ((x-\epsilon, x+\epsilon) - \{x\}) \cap C$ and $y \ne x$. 
           Thus $x$ is a limit point and not an isolated point.

          We have shown the cantor set, denoted as $C$, is a non-empty subset of the
          closed unit interval $\left[0,1\right]$ that is closed, contains no non-empty
          open interval, and no isolated points.

          We first show that these sets are disjoint. We show $A^\circ \cap \partial A = \varnothing$.

          Then for every open set $U$ of $p$ we have $(U-\{p\}) \cap (X-A) \ne \varnothing$. 
          Moreover, $p \in A$ since $p \in A^\circ$ so for every open set $U$ of $p$ 
          we have in particular $U \cap (X-A) \ne \varnothing$. Since $p \in A^\circ$ 
          there exists an open neighborhood $V$ such that $p \in V \subset A$. Then 
          $V \cap (X-A) = \varnothing$. This is a contradiction to $p$ being a limit 
          point of $X-A$. Hence, $A^\circ$ and $\partial A$ are disjoint. A similar

          $p \in A^\circ$ and $p \in (X-A)^\circ$ because that would imply $p \in A$ and

          Let $p \notin A^\circ$ and $p \notin \partial A$. For the sake of contradiction, 
          suppose $p \in A$. Then either $p$ is a limit point of $A$ or an isolated point 
          of $A$. Consider the case where $p$ is a limit point of $A$. Then $p$
          is in the closure of $A$. If $p$ is in the closure of $X-A$ then $p \in
          \partial A$ which is a contradiction. Thus, assume $p \notin \overline{X-A}$. 
          Then there exists some open neighborhood $V$ of $p$ such that 
          $V \cap (X-A) = \varnothing$ or equivalently $V \subset A$. Then we have 
          $p \in V \subset A$ which means $p$ is an interior point, $p \in A^\circ$. This 
          is a contradiction. Then $p$ cannot be a limit point of $A$ so assume $p$ is 
          an isolated point of $A$. For the sake of contradiction suppose $p$ is not a limit 
          point of $X-A$. Then there exists an open neighborhood $V$ of $p$ such that 
          $(V-\{p\}) \cap X-A = \varnothing$. In particular, $V \cap X-A = \varnothing$ since 
          $p \in A$. Then $V \subset A$. Then $p \in V \subset A$. Then $p \in A^\circ$. 
          This is a contradiction so $p$ is a limit point of $X-A$. Hence, 
          $p \in \overline{A} \cap \overline{X-A} = \partial A$. Once more, this is a 
          contradiction. Therefore, $p$ cannot be in $A$ since assuming $p \in A$ leads 
          to contradictions. Using the facts that $p \notin \partial A$ and $p \notin 
          (X-A)^\circ$, we can use an analogous argument to show $p \notin X-A$. If 
          $p \notin A$ and $p \notin X-A$, then $p \notin X$.  
          
          Then there exists some open neighborhood $W$ of $p$ 
          such that $(W-\{p\}) \cap A = \varnothing$. Then $(W-\{p\}) \subset X-A$.

          have $0 < 1/n < r$. It follows $x_i \in U$ for all $i \geq n$. Hence, our 
          sequence converges to $p$.

        <div class="proof">
          We prove the reverse direction first. Let $\mathcal{B}$ be a collection of 
          subsets of $X$ such that properties (1) and (2) hold. We show that $\mathcal{B}$
          is the basis for some topology on $X$. Specifically, we construct a topology, $\tau$ on $X$
          and show $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for $\tau$. Now define we define $\tau$: a 
          set $U$ is in $\tau$ if and only if $U$ is a union of elements in $\mathcal{B}$
          or is the empty set $\varnothing$. Now we verify $\tau$ is in fact a topology 
          on $X$. By definition of $\tau$, $\varnothing \in \tau$. Now we show $X \in \tau$. 
          By the first property of $\mathcal{B}$, for every point $p \in X$ there exists 
          an element $B_p \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $p \in B_p$. Then $X = \cup_{p \in X}B_p$. 
          This is a union of elements in $\mathcal{B}$ so $X$ is in fact open. Let 
          $U$ and $V$ be open sets. We show $U \cap V$ is also open. Since $U$ and $V$ are 
          open let $U = \cup_{C \in \mathcal{B}_1}C$ and $V = \cup_{D \in \mathcal{B}_2}D$ 
          where $\mathcal{B}_1,\mathcal{B}_2 \subset \mathcal{B}$. Let $p \in U \cap V$. 
          Then $p \in (\cup_{C \in \mathcal{B}_1}C) \bigcap (\cup_{D \in \mathcal{B}_2}D)$.
          Then $p \in C$ for some $C \in \mathcal{B}_1 \subset \mathcal{B}$ and 
          $p \in D$ for some $D \in \mathcal{B}_2 \subset \mathcal{B}$. Then by 
          the second property of $\mathcal{B}$, there a set $W_p \in \mathcal{B}$ such that 
          $p \in W_p \subset C \cap D$. In particular, $p \in W_p \subset U \cap V$. 
          Take $W = \cup_{p \in U \cap V} W_p$. Now we show $W = U \cap V$. If $p \in W$
          then $p \in W_q$ for some $q \in U \cap V$. Moreover, $W_q \subset U \cap V$. 
          Thus $p \in U \cap V$ and hence $W \subset U \cap V$. Let $p \in U \cap V$. Then 
          there is an associated $W_p$ such that $p \in W_p \subset \cup_{q \in U\cap V}W_q = W$. 
          Hence, $p \in W$ and $U \cap V \subset W$. Then $U\cap V = W$. Furthermore, $W$
          is a union of elements in $\mathcal{B}$ so $W$ is open in $\tau$. Thus, $U \cap V$
          must be in $\tau$. Suppose we have an arbitrary collection of sets 
          $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in \lambda}$ such that $U_\alpha \in \tau$ for all 
          $\alpha \in \lambda$. Then $\cup_{\alpha \in \lambda}U_\alpha$ is in $\tau$
          since each $U_\alpha$ is a union of sets in $\mathcal{B}$. It follows $\tau$ is 
          in fact a topology on $X$. Moreover, $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for $\tau$ since 
          by definition every set in $\tau$ is a union of elements in $\mathcal{B}$.
          <br><br>
          Now we prove the forward direction. We prove property (1) first. Let $\tau$
          be an arbitrary topology on $X$. Then $X = \cup_{B \in \mathcal{B}'}B$ 
          where $\mathcal{B}' \subset \mathcal{B}$. Let $p \in X$. Then 
          $p \in B$ for some $B \in \mathcal{B}' \subset \mathcal{B}$. Hence, the first 
          property holds. Now we prove the second property. Let $U,V \in \mathcal{B}$. 
          Then $U,V \in \tau$. Then $U \cap V \in \tau$ and 
          $U \cap V = \cup_{C \in \mathcal{B}''}C$ where $\mathcal{B}'' \subset \mathcal{B}$.
           Let $p \in U \cap V$. Then $p \in C$ for some $C \in \mathcal{B}'' \subset \mathcal{B}$.
           Therefore property (2) holds.

        <div class="proof">
          For parts (1) and (2), all subsets of the x-axis are closed. Now 
          we prove part (3). Since $A$ is countable let $A = \cup_{i\in\mathbb{N}} 
          (a_i,0)$ and let $z = (x,0)$. Now let $V = B((x,0),r)\cup \{(x,0)\}$ and 
          then $z \in V$. 
          Moreover, let for all $i\in\mathbb{N}$ let 
          \[U_i = B((a_i,r_i),r_i) \cup \{(a_i,0)\}\]
          where $r_i = (x-a_i)^2/(4r)$
          Then let $U = \cup_{i\in\mathbb{N}} U_i$. It follows 
          $A \subset U$ and we also know $z \in V$. Now we show $U \cap V = \varnothing$. 
          For the sake of contradiction let $(c,d) \in U \cap V$. Then $(c,d)
          \in U_i \cap V$ for some $i$. Then $(c,d) \in B((a_i,r_i),r_i)$ and 
          $(c,d) \in B((x,r),r)$. Then we have $d((c,d),(a_i,r_i)) \lt r_i$ and 
          $d((c,d),(x,r)) \lt r$. Then by the triangle inequality we have
          $d((a_i,r_i),(x,r)) \lt r_i + r$. Note the distance function here is 
          defined as $d \colon \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ as 
          $d(x,y) = (x^2+y^2)^{1/2}$. Then we have 
          \[\sqrt{(x-a_i)^2 + (r_i-r)^2} \lt (x-a_i)^2/(4r) + r\] 
          Then this inequality results in 
          \[r_i \lt (x-a_i)^2/(4r)\]
          But $r_i = (x-a_i)^2/(4r)$. This is a contradiction. Hence $U \cap V = \varnothing$. 
          <br><br>
          Now we prove part (4). Let $A$ and $C$ be disjoint countable sets on the 
          x-axis. Let $A = \cup_{i\in\mathbb{N}} (a_i,0)$ and $C = \cup_{i\in\mathbb{N}} (c_i,0)$.
          Then define $D = \cup_{i\in\mathbb{N}}(d_i,0)$ where 
          \[d_i = \begin{cases} 
          a_{i/2} & i \equiv 0 \pmod{2}\\
          c_{(i+1)/2} & i \equiv 1 \pmod{2}
          \end{cases}\]
          Now we define $W_i$ such that $W_i \in \tau$, $d_i \in W_i$, and $i \ne j$
          implies $W_i \cap W_j = \varnothing$. We construct $W_i$ recursively. 
          First let $W_1 = B((d_1,r_1),r_1) \cup \{(d_1,0)\}$ and take $r_1 > 0$. 
          Now given we constructed $W_1,W_2,\dots,W_{n-1}$, we construct $W_n$. 
          Let the set $R$ be defined as 
          \[R = \{\frac{1}{4r_i}(d_i-d_n)^2 \mid i = 1,2,\dots,n-1\}\]
          Take $r_n = \min R$ which is well-defined since $R$ is finite. 
          Then let $W_n = B((d_n,r_n),r_n)\cup\{(d_n,0)\}$. All that is 
          left to show is if $i \ne j$ then $W_i \cap W_j = \varnothing$. The 
          argument is analogous to part (3): by contradiction suppose there is 
          a point $p$ in the intersection which leads to a contradiction by 
          the triangle inequality.

          We prove the forward direction. Let $p \in X$. We show that $\{p\}$ is closed.
          Take a different point $q \in X$. Since $(X,\tau)$ is $T_1$ it follows 
          there exists an open set $U$ such that $q \in U$ but $p \notin U$. 
          It follows $(U-\{q\}) \cap \{p\} = \varnothing$. Hence, $q$ is not a limit 
          point of $\{p\}$. It follows $\{p\}$ is closed. Now we prove the reverse 
          direction. Suppose every point in $X$ is a closed set. We show that 
          the space $(X,\tau)$ is $T_1$. Take two distinct points $x,y$ in $X$. 
          Since every point is a closed set, the sets $X-\{x\}$ and $X-\{y\}$ are open.
          Then $y \in X-\{x\}$ and $x \in X-\{y\}$. It follows the top. space is $T_1$.

          Take two distinct points $p$ and $q$ in $X$. Consider the sets $X-\{p\}$

          We prove part (1). Certainly $\inf \{d(a,p) \mid a \in A\}$ is non-negative 
          since the distance function must be non-negative. For the sake of 
          contradiction suppose $\inf \{d(a,p) \mid a \in A\} = 0$. Then 
          let $U$ be an open neighborhood of $p$. Then for some $\varepsilon > 0$ we 
          have $B(p,\varepsilon) \subset U$. Then there exist $a \in A$ such that 
          $d(a,p) < \varepsilon$ otherwise $\inf \{d(a,p) \mid a \in A\} \geq \varepsilon$. 
          It follows $(U-\{p\}) \cap A \ne \varnothing$. Then $p$ is a limit point of $A$. 
          Since $A$ is closed $p \in A$ but this is a contradiction. 
          <br><br>
          Now we prove part (2). Let $X = \mathbb{R}^2$, $p \in X$, and $A$ a closed subset 
          of $X$ that does not contain $p$. Then let $\delta = \inf \{d(a,p) \mid a \in A\}$. 
          By part (1) $\delta > 0$. Take $U = B(p,\delta/2)$ and 
          $V = \{x \mid d(p,x) > \delta/2\}$. Then $p \in U$, $A \subset V$, and 
          $U \cap V = \varnothing$.

          For part (3) let $A = \{(x,1/x) \mid x \geq 1\}$ and $B = \{(x,0) \mid x \geq 1\}$. 
          <br><br>
          Let $A, C$ be closed subsets of $\mathbb{R}^2$ with the standard topology. 
          Then define the maps $d_A \colon A \to \mathbb{R}$ and $d_C \colon C \to 
          \mathbb{R}$ as 
          \[d_A(a) = \inf \{d(a,c) \mid c \in C\}\]
          \[d_C(c) = \inf \{d(a,c) \mid a \in A\}\]
          Then let $A \subset \bigcup_{a \in A} B(a,d_A(a)) = U$ and 
          $C \subset \bigcup_{c \in C} B(c,d_C(c)) = V$. 
          Now we show $U \cap V = \varnothing$. For the sake of contradiction suppose 
          $p \in U \cap V$. Then $p \in B(a,d_A(a)/2)$ and $p \in B(c,d_C(c)/2)$ for some 
          $a \in A$ and $c \in C$. Then we have 
          $d(a,p) < d_A(a)/2$ and $d(p,c) < d_C(c)/2$. Then by the triangle inequality 
          we have $d(a,c) < d_A(a)/2 + d_C(c)/2$. Note $d_A(a)/2 \leq d(a,c)/2$ and 
          $d_C(c)/2 \leq d(a,c)/2$. The altogether we have
          \[d(a,c) < d_A(a)/2 + d_C(c)/2 \leq d(a,c)\]
          This is a contradiction. Hence, $U \cap V = \varnothing$. Hence, $\mathbb{R}^2$
          is normal.

          Every regular space is hereditarily regular.

        <div class="proof">
          Let $X$ be regular and $Y \subset X$. We show $Y$ is regular. 
          Let $p \in Y$ and $U \in \tau_Y$ such that $p \in U$. Then 
          there exists $U' \in \tau_X$ such that $U = Y \cap U'$. Then 
          $p \in U'$ and $U' \in \tau_X$. Since $X$ is regular there 
          exists an open neighborhood $V'$ of $p$ in $X$ such that 
          $p \in V'$ and $\text{Cl}_X(V') \subset U'$. Take $V = Y \cap V'$. 
          It follows $p \in V$. Now we show $\text{Cl}_Y(V) \subset U$.
          Let $q \in \text{Cl}_Y(V)$. If $q \in V$ then $q \in U$ since 
          $V' \subset U'$ and $V = Y \cap V'$ and $U = Y \cap U'$. 
          Now suppose $q$ is a limit point of $V$ in the subspace topology. 
          Then for every open neighborhood $W$ of $q$ in $Y$ we have
          $(W-\{q\}) \cap V \ne \varnothing$. It follows for all 
          $A \in \tau_X$ that $((A \cap Y)-\{q\}) \cap V \ne \varnothing$. 
          Then $(A-\{q\}) \cap V \ne \varnothing$. Moreover, since $V \subset V'$
          it follows for all $A$ that $(A-\{q\}) \cap V' \ne \varnothing$. 
          Then $q$ is a limit point of $V'$ in $(X,\tau_X)$. It follows 
          $q \in \text{Cl}_X(V') \subset U'$. Then $q \in U'$. Moreover, $q \in Y$
          so then $q \in U' \cap Y = U$. Hence, $\text{Cl}_Y(V) \subset U$. 
          Therefore, $(Y,\tau_Y)$ is regular.

        <div class="proof">
          Let $A$ be a closed subset of a normal space $X$. Now let $B$ be a
          subset of $A$ and closed in $(A,\tau_A)$. Let $U \in \tau_A$ such that 
          $U \supset B$. Then there exist $U' \in \tau_X$ such that $U = A \cap U'$ 
          and $B'$ closed in $X$ such that $B = A \cap B'$. Since $A$ and $B'$ are 
          closed in $X$ and intersections of closed sets are closed, it follows 
          $B$ must be closed in $X$. By normality of $X$ there is a set $W \in \tau_X$
          such that $B \subset W$ and $\text{Cl}_X(W) \subset U'$. 
          Moreover, $B \subset W \cap A$. Now we show $\text{Cl}_A(W \cap A) \subset U$. 
          Let $p \in \text{Cl}_A(W \cap A)$. If $p \in W \cap A$ then $p \in U$
          since $W \subset U'$. Now suppose $p$ is a limit point of $W \cap A$ in 
          $(A, \tau_A)$. Then for every neighborhood $S \in \tau_A$ of $p$ we have
          $(S-\{p\}) \cap (W \cap A) \ne \varnothing$. It follows for every 
          open neighborhood $S' \in \tau_X$ we have 
          $(S'-\{p\}) \cap W \ne \varnothing$. Then $p$ is a limit point of $W$ 
          in $(X,\tau_X)$. Then $p \in \text{Cl}_X(W) \subset U'$. Then $p \in U'$.
          Moreover, $p \in A$ so $p \in A \cap U' = U$. Hence, $\text{Cl}_A(W \cap A) 
          \subset U$. It follows $A$ is normal.
