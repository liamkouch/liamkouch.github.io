          A <strong>topological space</strong> is an ordered pair $(X,\tau)$, where $X$

          A set $U \subset X$ is called an <strong>open set</strong> in $(X,\tau)$
          if and only if $U \in \tau$.

        <div class="theorem">
          Let $\{U_i\}_{i=1}^n$ be a finite collection of open sets in a topological 
          $(X, \tau)$. Then $\cap_{i=1}^n U_i$ is open.
        </div>
        <div class="proof">
          We prove by inducting on $n$. The base case for $n = 1$ is trivially true.
          For the inductive hypothesis assume $P(m)$ is true where $P(m)$ denotes
          the theorem statement for $n = m$. We show $P(m+1)$ is true. Now suppose we 
          a collection of $m+1$ open sets, $\{U_i\}_{i=1}^{m+1}$. By the hypothesis
          it follows $\cap_{i=1}^m U_i$ is open. Since the intersection of two open
          sets is an open set we have $(\cap_{i=1}^m U_i) \cap U_{m+1} \in \tau$. Hence,
          $\cap_{i=1}^{m+1} U_i \in \tau$. This concludes the induction.
        </div>

        <div class="exercise">
          Why does your proof not prove the false statement that the infinite 
          intersection of open sets is necessarily open?
        </div>
        The above proof only shows that a finite intersection is open. Counterexample: 
        consider $\tau_\text{std}$ on $\mathbb{R}$. Then the intersection over the 
        collection $\{I_i\}_{i=1}^n$ where $I_j = (-1/j,1/j)$ is just $\{0\}$. However,
        this is not open. 
        <div class="theorem">
          A set $U$ is open in a topological space $(X,\tau)$ if and only if for 
          every point $x \in U$, there exists an open set $U_x$ such that
          $x \in U_x \subset U$.
        </div>
        <div class="proof">
          For the forward direction take $U_x = U$. For the reverse direction
          consider $\cup_{x \in U} U_x$ and note it is open since it is a union 
          of open sets. We show $U = \cup_{x \in U} U_x$. First we show
          $U \subset \cup_{x \in U} U_x$. Let $p \in U$. Then there exists 
          a corresponding $U_p$. Then $p \in U_p \subset \cup_{x \in U} U_x$.
          Hence, $U \subset \cup_{x \in U} U_x$. Now we show
          $U \supset \cup_{x \in U} U_x$. Let $q \in \cup_{x \in U} U_x$. Then
          $q \in U_x$ for some $x \in U$. Moreover, $U_x \subset U$ for any
          $x$. Hence, $q \in U_x \subset U$. Therefore, 
          $U \supset \cup_{x \in U} U_x$. It follows $U = \cup_{x \in U} U_x$.
          Furthermore, we know the right side is open so then $U$ must also be
          open.

          In $\mathbb{R}^n$, the <strong>Euclidean distance</strong> between 
          points $x = (x_1,\dots,x_n)$ and $y=(y_1,\dots,y_n)$ is defined as
          \[d(x,y) = (\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-y_i)^2)^{1/2}\]

          Then an <strong>open ball</strong> of radius $\varepsilon > 0$ around
          point $p \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is the set
          \[B(p,\varepsilon) = \{x \mid d(p,x) < \varepsilon\}\]
          Moreover, the <stong>standard topology</strong> $\tau_{\text{std}}$ on 
          $\mathbb{R}^n$ is defined as follows: a subset $U$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$
          belongs to $\tau_{\text{std}}$ if and only if for each point $p$ of
          $U$ there is an $\varepsilon_p > 0$ such that $B(p,\varepsilon_p)
          \subset U$.
        </div>
        <div class="exercise">
          The $\tau_{\text{std}}$ is a topology on $\mathbb{R}^n$.
        </div>
     
        <div class="proof">
          The empty set is open vacuously. For whole set $\mathbb{R}^n$ consider 
          any point $p \in \mathbb{R}^n$. Then we can take the ball $B(p,1)$. Then 
          $p \in B(p,1) \subset \mathbb{R}^n$. It follows the whole set is open.
          Now consider two open sets $U$ and $V$. Consider a point $p$ in their 
          intersection $U \cap V$. Since $U$ and $V$ are open and $p \in U$ and
          $p \in V$ there exists $r_u,r_v > 0$ such that $B(p,r_u) \subset U$ and 
          $B(p,r_v) \subset V$. Take $r = \min\{r_u,r_v\}$. Then $B(p,r) \subset U$
          and $B(p,r)\subset V$. Hence, $B(p,r) \subset U \cap V$. Now consider a
          collection of open sets $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in \lambda}$. Take a point 
          $p \in \cup_{\alpha \in \lambda} U_\alpha$. 
          Then $p \in U_\beta$ for some $\beta \in \lambda$. Since $U_\beta$ is open we have 
          $p \in B(p,r) \subset \cup_{\alpha \in \lambda} U_\alpha$ for some $r > 0$. 
          Hence, the union over the collection 
          $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in \lambda}$ is open. It follows $\tau_\text{std}$ is a topology.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
          Given a set $X$, let $\tau = 2^X$, the set of all subsets of $X$. This topology 
          $\tau$ is called the <strong>discrete topology</strong> on $X$. We call the 
          space $(X,2^X)$ a <strong>discrete topological space</strong>. 
        </div>

        <div class="example">
          Given a set $X$, the collection $\tau = \{\varnothing, X\}$ is called the 
          <strong>indiscrete topology</strong> on $X$. We call the space 
          $(X, \{\varnothing,X\})$ an <strong>indiscrete topological space</strong>. 
          In this space, there are only two open sets: the empty set and the entire set 
          $X$.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
          Given a set $X$, the <strong>finite complement</strong> of cofinite topology 
          on $X$ is described as follows: a subset $U$ of $X$ is open if and only if 
          $X-U$ is finite or $U = \varnothing$.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
          Given a set $X$, the <strong>countable complement</strong> or cocountable topology on $X$ 
          is described as follows: a subset $U$ of $X$ is open if and only if $X-U$ is 
          countable or $U = \varnothing$.
        </div>
        
        <div class = "exercise">
          Verify that the discrete, indiscrete, finite complement, and countable complement 
          topologies are indeed topologies for any set $X$.
        </div>
        <div class="proof">
          We first verify the discrete topology. Since every subset of $X$ is open, 
          $\varnothing$ and $X$ itself are open. If $U$ and $V$ are open sets. Then their
          intersection is another subset of $X$. Hence, $U \cap V$ is open. Moreover, an 
          arbitrary union of open sets is a subset of $X$ so then the union must also be 
          open. It follows the discrete topology is in fact a topology.
          <br><br>
          Second we verify the indiscrete topology. By definition $\varnothing$ and $X$ 
          are open. Since these are the only two sets, there is only one intersection to 
          consider, $\varnothing \cap X = \varnothing$. Hence, open sets are closed under 
          intersection. Consider an arbitrary collection of open sets $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in \lambda}$.
          If for all $\alpha \in \lambda$, $U_\alpha = \varnothing$, then the union over
          the collection is $\varnothing$. Otherwise if for some $\alpha \in \lambda$ we have
          $U_\alpha = X$, then the union of the collection is $X$. In either case, the union 
          over the collection is open. It follows the indiscrete topology is indeed a topology.
          <br><br>
          Third, we verify the cofinite topoology. By definition the empty set is open. 
          Since $X - X = \varnothing$ which is finite, it follows $X$ is open. Now consider 
          two open sets $U$ and $V$. Then consider $X - (U \cap V)$. By De Morgan's law 
          we have $(X - U) \cup (X - V)$. We know $X-U$ and $X-V$ are finite and the union 
          of two finite sets is finite. Hence, $U \cap V$ is open. Now consider the arbitrary 
          collection of open sets $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in \lambda}$. Consider $X-\cup_{\alpha \in \lambda} U_\alpha$. 
          This equates to $\cap_{\alpha \in \lambda} (X - U_\alpha)$. We know $X - U_\beta$
          for some $\beta \in \lambda$ is finite and $\cap_{\alpha \in \lambda} (X - U_\alpha) \subset X-\beta$. 
          It follows $\cap_{\alpha \in \lambda} (X - U_\alpha)$ is finite. Hence, the arbitrary 
          collection of open sets is in fact open. Therefore, the confinite topology is a topology.
          <br><br>
          Lastly, we verify the cocountable topology. By definition the empty set is again 
          open. $X-X = \varnothing$ which is finite implying countable. Since the union of 
          two countable sets is countable, it follows if $X-V$ and $X-U$ are countable, their 
          intersection is as well. Consider the arbitrary collection of open sets $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in \lambda}$. 
          Then consider $X - \cup_{\alpha \in \lambda}U_\alpha$. This is equivalent to 
          $\cap_{\alpha \in \lambda} (X-U_\alpha)$. This is at most countable. Hence, the 
          cocountable topology is a topology.

        <div class="exercise">
