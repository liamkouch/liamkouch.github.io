          We show $f^{-1}(A \cup B) = f^{-1}(A) \cup f^{-1}(B)$. Let $x \in

          $x \in f^{-1}(A)$ or if $f(x) \in B$ then $x \in f^{-1}(B)$. Thus

          Suppose a submarine is moving in the plane along a straight line at a 
          constant speed such that at each hour, the submarine is at a lattice 
          point, that is, a point whose two coordinates are both integers. 
          Suppose at each hour you can explode one depth charge at a lattice 
          point that will hit the submarine if it is there. You do not know the 
          submarine's direction, speed, or its current position. Prove that you 
          can explode one depth charge each hour in such a way that you will be 
          guaranteed to eventually hit the submarine.
        </div>
        <div class="proof">
          Say the submarine is in the $\mathbb{R}^2$ plane. 
          Since we don't know the direction, speed, or position of the 
          submarine in the plane, the general form of the position of 
          the submarine with respect to time is
          \[(x_0 + at, y_0 + bt)\]
          where $x_0$ is the initial x-coordinate, 
          $a$ is the horizontal velocity, $y_0$ is the initial 
          y-coordinate, $b$ is the vertical velocity, and $t$ is the 
          time past the starting time. We have $x_0,a,y_0,b \in \mathbb{Z}$ 
          and $t \in \mathbb{N}$.  We know $\mathbb{Z}^4$ is a finite 
          cartesian product of countably infinite sets and is therefore 
          countable.  Then there is the bijection 
          $f \colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}^4$ defined as 
          \[f(t) = (f_x(t),f_a(t), f_y(t), f_b(t))\]
          Since $f$ is a bijection it follows for any choice of 
          $x_0, a, y_0,$ and $b$ there exists some $t \in \mathbb{N}$
          such that $f(t) = (x_0,a,y_0,b)$. Since $\mathbb{Z}^4$ is 
          countable it follows we can check every possible direction, 
          speed, and original position of the submarine.  Suppose we want 
          to hit the submarine with initial horizontal position $x_0$, 
          horizontal velocity $a$, initial vertical position $y_0$, and 
          vertical velocity $b$. Then at time $t_0 = f^{-1}(x_0,a,y_0,b)$
          we explode a depth charge at coordinate
          \[(x,y) = (f_x(t_0) + f_a(t_0)t_0, f_y(t_0) + f_b(t_0)t_0)\]
          It follows we can be guaranteed to eventually hit the submarine.

        <div class="proof">
          We prove by inducting on $n$. The base case for $n = 1$ is trivially true.
          For the inductive hypothesis assume $P(m)$ is true where $P(m)$ denotes
          the theorem statement for $n = m$. We show $P(m+1)$ is true. Now suppose we 
          a collection of $m+1$ open sets, $\{U_i\}_{i=1}^{m+1}$. By the hypothesis
          it follows $\cap_{i=1}^m U_i$ is open. Since the intersection of two open
          sets is an open set we have $(\cap_{i=1}^m U_i) \cap U_{m+1} \in \tau$. Hence,
          $\cap_{i=1}^{m+1} U_i \in \tau$. This concludes the induction.

          Why does your proof not prove the false statement that the infinite 
          intersection of open sets is necessarily open?
        </div>
        The above proof only shows that a finite intersection is open. Counterexample: 
        consider $\tau_\text{std}$ on $\mathbb{R}$. Then the intersection over the 
        collection $\{I_i\}_{i=1}^n$ where $I_j = (-1/j,1/j)$ is just $\{0\}$. However,
        this is not open.

          A set $U$ is open in a topological space $(X,\tau)$ if and only if for 
          every point $x \in U$, there exists an open set $U_x$ such that
          $x \in U_x \subset U$.
        </div>
        <div class="proof">
          For the forward direction take $U_x = U$. For the reverse direction
          consider $\cup_{x \in U} U_x$ and note it is open since it is a union 
          of open sets. We show $U = \cup_{x \in U} U_x$. First we show
          $U \subset \cup_{x \in U} U_x$. Let $p \in U$. Then there exists 
          a corresponding $U_p$. Then $p \in U_p \subset \cup_{x \in U} U_x$.
          Hence, $U \subset \cup_{x \in U} U_x$. Now we show
          $U \supset \cup_{x \in U} U_x$. Let $q \in \cup_{x \in U} U_x$. Then
          $q \in U_x$ for some $x \in U$. Moreover, $U_x \subset U$ for any
          $x$. Hence, $q \in U_x \subset U$. Therefore, 
          $U \supset \cup_{x \in U} U_x$. It follows $U = \cup_{x \in U} U_x$.
          Furthermore, we know the right side is open so then $U$ must also be
          open.

          belongs to $\tau_{\text{std}}$ if and only if for each point $p$ of
          $U$ there is an $\varepsilon_p > 0$ such that $B(p,\varepsilon_p)

          The $\tau_{\text{std}}$ is a topology on $\mathbb{R}^n$.

        <div class="proof">
          The empty set is open vacuously. For whole set $\mathbb{R}^n$ consider 
          any point $p \in \mathbb{R}^n$. Then we can take the ball $B(p,1)$. Then 
          $p \in B(p,1) \subset \mathbb{R}^n$. It follows the whole set is open.
          Now consider two open sets $U$ and $V$. Consider a point $p$ in their 
          intersection $U \cap V$. Since $U$ and $V$ are open and $p \in U$ and
          $p \in V$ there exists $r_u,r_v > 0$ such that $B(p,r_u) \subset U$ and 
          $B(p,r_v) \subset V$. Take $r = \min\{r_u,r_v\}$. Then $B(p,r) \subset U$
          and $B(p,r)\subset V$. Hence, $B(p,r) \subset U \cap V$. Now consider a
          collection of open sets $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in \lambda}$. Take a point 
          $p \in \cup_{\alpha \in \lambda} U_\alpha$. 
          Then $p \in U_\beta$ for some $\beta \in \lambda$. Since $U_\beta$ is open we have 
          $p \in B(p,r) \subset \cup_{\alpha \in \lambda} U_\alpha$ for some $r > 0$. 
          Hence, the union over the collection 
          $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in \lambda}$ is open. It follows $\tau_\text{std}$ is a topology.

          Given a set $X$, let $\tau = 2^X$, the set of all subsets of $X$. This topology 
          $\tau$ is called the <strong>discrete topology</strong> on $X$. We call the 
          space $(X,2^X)$ a <strong>discrete topological space</strong>. 
        </div>

        <div class="example">
          Given a set $X$, the collection $\tau = \{\varnothing, X\}$ is called the

          In this space, there are only two open sets: the empty set and the entire set 
          $X$.

          $X-U$ is finite or $U = \varnothing$.

        <div class="example">

          countable or $U = \varnothing$.

        <div class = "exercise">
          Verify that the discrete, indiscrete, finite complement, and countable complement 
          topologies are indeed topologies for any set $X$.
        </div>
        <div class="proof">
          We first verify the discrete topology. Since every subset of $X$ is open, 
          $\varnothing$ and $X$ itself are open. If $U$ and $V$ are open sets. Then their
          intersection is another subset of $X$. Hence, $U \cap V$ is open. Moreover, an 
          arbitrary union of open sets is a subset of $X$ so then the union must also be 
          open. It follows the discrete topology is in fact a topology.
          <br><br>
          Second we verify the indiscrete topology. By definition $\varnothing$ and $X$ 
          are open. Since these are the only two sets, there is only one intersection to 
          consider, $\varnothing \cap X = \varnothing$. Hence, open sets are closed under 
          intersection. Consider an arbitrary collection of open sets $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in \lambda}$.
          If for all $\alpha \in \lambda$, $U_\alpha = \varnothing$, then the union over
          the collection is $\varnothing$. Otherwise if for some $\alpha \in \lambda$ we have
          $U_\alpha = X$, then the union of the collection is $X$. In either case, the union 
          over the collection is open. It follows the indiscrete topology is indeed a topology.
          <br><br>
          Third, we verify the cofinite topoology. By definition the empty set is open. 
          Since $X - X = \varnothing$ which is finite, it follows $X$ is open. Now consider 
          two open sets $U$ and $V$. Then consider $X - (U \cap V)$. By De Morgan's law 
          we have $(X - U) \cup (X - V)$. We know $X-U$ and $X-V$ are finite and the union 
          of two finite sets is finite. Hence, $U \cap V$ is open. Now consider the arbitrary 
          collection of open sets $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in \lambda}$. Consider $X-\cup_{\alpha \in \lambda} U_\alpha$. 
          This equates to $\cap_{\alpha \in \lambda} (X - U_\alpha)$. We know $X - U_\beta$
          for some $\beta \in \lambda$ is finite and $\cap_{\alpha \in \lambda} (X - U_\alpha) \subset X-\beta$. 
          It follows $\cap_{\alpha \in \lambda} (X - U_\alpha)$ is finite. Hence, the arbitrary 
          collection of open sets is in fact open. Therefore, the confinite topology is a topology.
          <br><br>
          Lastly, we verify the cocountable topology. By definition the empty set is again 
          open. $X-X = \varnothing$ which is finite implying countable. Since the union of 
          two countable sets is countable, it follows if $X-V$ and $X-U$ are countable, their 
          intersection is as well. Consider the arbitrary collection of open sets $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in \lambda}$. 
          Then consider $X - \cup_{\alpha \in \lambda}U_\alpha$. This is equivalent to 
          $\cap_{\alpha \in \lambda} (X-U_\alpha)$. This is at most countable. Hence, the 
          cocountable topology is a topology.

          Describe some of the open sets you get if $\mathbb{R}$ is endowed with the

        Let $\tau_1, \tau_2, \tau_3,\tau_4$ be the $\mathbb{R}$ endowed with the indiscrete, cofinite, cocountable,

        We construct a case for the cofinite topology on $\mathbb{R}$. 
        For $i \in \mathbb{N}$ define $U_i = \mathbb{R} - \{1,\dots,i\}$. Each of 
        these sets is open in the cofinite topology. We show the infinite intersection 
        over these sets is not open.
        \[\mathbb{R}-\bigcap_{i \in \mathbb{N}} U_i = \bigcup_{i \in \mathbb{N}} (\mathbb{R}-U_i)

        The complement of the infinite intersection is not finite, so not open.

        Now we construct a case for the cocountable topology on $\mathbb{R}$. 
        We define a collection of sets as follows: for $\alpha \in

        \[U_\alpha = \left\{\alpha + x \mid x \in \mathbb{R}-\mathbb{N}\right\}\]

        \bigcup_{\alpha \in \left[0,1\right)} (\mathbb{R}-U_\alpha) = \left[1,\infty\right)\]
        The complement of the infinite intersection is not countable, hence not open.

          In the indiscrete topology, the only open set that contains $0$ is $\mathbb{R}$.

          We show that $\overline{A}$ contains all its limit points. Let $p$ be a limit point

          by definition we have $(U-\{p\}) \cap \overline{A} \ne \varnothing$ for any open

          Since $U$ is also an open neighborhood of $q$ and $q$ is a limit point of $A$, it follows

          We prove the forward direction first. Let $p \in X-A$. Since $A$ is closed, $p$

          $p \in U \subset X-A$. Hence, by Theorem 2.3 $X-A$ is open. Now we prove the 
          reverse direction. Say $X-A$ is open. We show $A$ is closed. Let $q$ be a limit point

          $(W-\{p\}) \cap A = \varnothing$. But this contradicts $p$ being a limit point of $A$.

          We utililze mainly Theorem 2.13. Since $X$ and $\varnothing$ are open we 
          know their complements are closed, that is $\varnothing$ and $X$ are closed 
          respectively. Suppose we have a finite union of closed sets
          $\cup_{i=1}^n U_i$. We show this is closed by showing the complement is open.
          The complement of this finite union is the finite intersection $\cap_{i=1}^n (X-U_i)$.
          This is a finite intersection of open sets. This is open. Hence, the finite union 
          is closed. Now suppose we have a collection of closed sets $\{A_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in \lambda}$. 
          To show the intersection over the collection is closed we show the complement is open.
          The complement of the intersection is the union $\bigcup_{\alpha \in \lambda} (X-A_\alpha)$.
          This is an arbitrary union of open sets which is open. Hence, the arbitrary intersection 
          is closed.

          $W \subset \overline{A}$. Now we show $\overline{A} \subset W$. Take

          We show the cantor set satisfies the criteria above. 
          We construct the cantor set. Let $C_0 = \left[0,1\right]$. 
          Then $C_{n-1}$ consists of $2^n$ closed intervals. For each interval, 
          take out the middle third. Then this is defined to be $C_n$. For example,
          
          \[C_0 = \left[0,1\right] \]
          \[C_1 = \left[0,1/3\right] \cup \left[2/3, 1\right]\]
          \[C_2 = \left[0,1/9\right] \cup \left[2/9,3/9\right] \cup \left[6/9,7/9\right] \cup \left[8/9, 1\right]\]
          Generally we have
          \[C_n = I_n^1 \cup I_n^2 \cup I_n^3 \cup \cdots \cup I_n^{2^n}\]
          
          Where if $j < k$ then $x < y$ for all $x \in I_i^j, y \in I_i^k$ 
          for all $j,k \in \{1,2,3,...,2^i\}$ and all $i \in \mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$. 
          Then the cantor set is defined to be $C = \cap_{i=1}^\infty C_i$. We now show 
          $C$ is a subset of the interval $\left[0,1\right]$, closed, contains no non-empty 
          open interval, and no point of $C$ is an isolated point.

          Since  $\left[0,1\right]  \supset C_0 \supset C_1  \supset \cdots$ it follows $C 
          \subset \left[0,1\right]$. Moreover, $C$ is an infinite intersection of closed 
          sets which is closed by Theorem 2.16. Now we show that $C$ contains no non-empty 
          open interval. For sake of contradiction, suppose that $C$ contains a non-empty open 
          interval $(s,t)$ where $s < t$ and $s,t \in \mathbb{R}$.

          Let $P(n)$ be the statement "Let $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$ and $a < b$. 
          If $(a,b) \subset C_n$ then $|a-b| \leq 1/3^n$ for some non-negative 
          integer $n$." We show that $p(n)$ is true for all $n \geq 0$ by induction. 
          For the base case, consider $n=0$. Then suppose $(a,b) \subset C_0 = 
          \left[0,1\right]$. Then we have $0 \leq a < b \leq 1$. It follows $|a-b| 
          \leq 1 = 1/3^0$. It follows $P(0)$ is true. 

          Now we move on to the inductive step. For the inductive hypothesis 
          we assume $P(m)$ is true. Now assume $(a,b) \subset C_{m+1}$. Since 
          $C_{m+1} \subset C_m$ it follows $(a,b) \subset C_m$. Then $C_m$ has 
          $2^m$ disjoint closed intervals.
          \[C_m = I_m^1 \cup I_m^2 \cup I_m^3 \cup \cdots \cup I_m^{2^m}\]
          where $I_w^z$ is the zth closed interval for $C_w$. It follows $(a,b)$ 
          is in exactly one of these intervals. Then let $(a,b) = I_m^k$ for some 
          $k \in \{1,2,...,2^m\}$. Then $I_m^k=\left[c,d\right]$ where $c,d \in 
          \mathbb{R}$. Since $(a,b)\subset\left[c,d\right]$ we have $c \leq a < b 
          \leq d$. It follows $|a-b|\leq d-c$. For the sake of contradiction 
          suppose $d-c>1/3^m$. Then there exists $p,q\in\mathbb{R}$ such that 
          $(p,q) \subset C_m$ and $|p-q| > 1/3^m$; however, since $(p,q) \subset 
          C_m$ we must have $|p-q| \leq 1/3^m$ by the inductive hypothesis. This 
          is a contradiction. It follows $d-c\leq 1/3^m$. 

          Since $(a,b)\subset \left[c,d\right] \subset C_m$ and by assumption 
          $(a,b)\subset C_{m+1}$, it follows $(a,b)$ falls in the left or right 
          third of $\left[c,d\right]$. Specifically, $(a,b) \subset 
          \left[c,c+\frac{1}{3}(d-c)\right]$ or $(a,b) \subset 
          \left[c+\frac{2}{3}(d-c),d\right]$. Then we have 
          \[c \leq a < b \leq c+\frac{1}{3}(d-c)\]
          or
          \[c + \frac{2}{3}(d-c) \leq a < b \leq d\]
          In either case we have $|a-b| \leq (d-c)/3$. But $d-c \leq 1/3^m$ 
          so then $|a-b| \leq 1/3^{m+1}$. It follows $P(m+1)$ is true. This 
          concludes the induction. Hence, $P(n)$ is true for all $n \geq 0$. 

          We assumed that $(s,t) \subset C$. Then $(s,t) \subset C_m$ for all 
          $m \in \mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$. Since we showed $P(n)$ is true for all 
          $n \in \mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$, it follows $|s-t| \leq 1/3^m$ for all $m$. 
          Suppose $|s-t| > 0$. Then by the archimedean property there exists a 
          sufficiently large $m$ such that $|s-t| > 1/3^m$. It follows $|s-t| = 0$. 
          Moreover $(s,t) \in \left[0,1\right]$ so then $0 < s,t$ which implies $s=t$.
           But this is a contradiction since this implies $(s,t)$ is an empty open 
           interval. Moreover, we assumed $s < t$. Hence, $C$ contains no non-empty 
           open interval.

          Now we show $C$ contains no isolated points. Let $P^*(n)$ be the statement 
          "let $x \in \mathbb{R}$. If $x \in C_n$ there exists $y \in \mathbb{R}$ such 
          that $y\ne x$, $y \in C$, and $|x-y| \leq 1/3^n$ for some non-negative integer
           $n$." We show $P^*(n)$ is true for all non-negative integers. Suppose 
           $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and $x \in C_i$ for some $i \in \mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$.
          Then 
          \[C_i = I_i^1 \cup I_i^2 \cup I_i^3 \cup \cdots \cup I_i^{2^i} \]
          Then $x \in I_i^j$ for some $j \in \{1,2,3,...,2^i\}$. 
          Then $I_i^j = \left[c,d\right]$ where $c,d \in \mathbb{R}$ and $c < d$. 
          Then $c \leq x \leq d$. If $x < d$ then let $y = d$ so then $(x,y) 
          \subset C_i$. Otherwise if $x = d$ then let $y = c$ so then $(y,x) 
          \subset C_i$. In either case, the hypothesis of $P(i)$ (note $P(i)$ 
          not $P^*(i)$) is satisfied so then by the implication of $P(i)$ we have 
          $|x-y| \leq 1/3^i$. Moreover $y \ne x$.

          Now we show $y \in C$. Notice $y =d$ or $y = c$ for $I_i^j$. 
          If suffices to show that if $y$ is an endpoint of some closed 
          interval $I_p^q$ (where $p \in \mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$ and $q \in 
          \{1,2,3,...,2^p\}$), then $y \in C$. 

          Suppose $y$ is an endpoint of some interval in $C_k$ where 
          $k\geq0$. Then 
          \[
          y \in I_k^\ell = \left[c_k^\ell, d_k^\ell \right]
          \]
          for some $\ell \in \{1,2,3,...,2^k\}$ and $c_k^\ell$ and 
          $d_k^\ell$ are the corresponding endpoints. Since $y$ is an 
          endpoint of $I_k^\ell$ we have either $y = c_k^\ell$ or $y = d_k^\ell$.
           If $y = c_k^\ell$ then 
          \[
          y \in I_{k+1}^{2\ell-1} = 
          \left[y,d_{k+1}^{2\ell-1}\right]=\left[y,c_k^\ell+(d_k^\ell-c_k^\ell)/3\right]
          \]
          Then $y = c_{k+1}^{2\ell-1}$. If $y = d_k^\ell$ then 
          \[
          y \in I_{k+1}^{2\ell} = \left[c_{k+1}^{2\ell}, y\right] = 
          \left[c_k^\ell+2(d_k^\ell-c_k^\ell)/3,y\right]
          \]
          Then $y = d_{k+1}^{2\ell}$. It follows $y$ is an endpoint of some interval 
          in $C_{k+1}$. Hence, we have shown if $y$ is an endpoint of some interval
           in $C_k$ then $y$ is an endpoint of some interval in $C_{k+1}$. 

          Recall that we showed that if $x \in C_i$ then there exists $x\ne y \in C_i$
          such $|x-y|\leq 1/3^i$. Moreover, we take $y$ as an endpoint in some closed 
          interval $I_i^j$. It follows $y$ is an endpoint of some interval in $C_i$.
          We have shown that if $y$ is an endpoint of some interval in $C_k$ then $y$
          is an endpoint of some interval in $C_{k+1}$ for all $k\geq 0$. By induction,
          t follows $y$ is an endpoint of $C_m$ and therefore $y \in C_m$ for all 
          $m \geq i$. Moreover, we have $C_0 \supset C_1 \supset \cdots \supset C_i$.
          It follows $y \in C_v$ (but not necessarily an endpoint of) for all 
          $0 \leq v < i$. It follows $y \in C_w$ for all $w \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{0\}$. 
          Thus $y \in C$. It follows $P^*(n)$ is true for all $n \in \mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$.

          Using $P^*(n)$ we show there exists no isolated points in $C$. 
          Let $x \in C$ and suppose we have the open set $U = (x-\epsilon, x+\epsilon)$ 
          where $\epsilon\in\mathbb{R}$ and $\epsilon>0$. Then by the archimedean 
          property there exists a sufficiently large $n \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{0\}$ 
          such that $1/3^n < \epsilon$. Then let $m \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{0\}$ such 
          that $1/3^m < \epsilon$. Since $x \in C$ it follows $x \in C_m$. Then by 
          $P^*(m)$ it follows there exists a $y \in C$ such that $|x-y| \leq 1/3^m < \epsilon$.
           It follows $((x-\epsilon, x+\epsilon) - \{x\}) \cap C \ne \varnothing$ 
           since $y \in ((x-\epsilon, x+\epsilon) - \{x\}) \cap C$ and $y \ne x$. 
           Thus $x$ is a limit point and not an isolated point.

          We have shown the cantor set, denoted as $C$, is a non-empty subset of the
          closed unit interval $\left[0,1\right]$ that is closed, contains no non-empty
          open interval, and no isolated points.

          of $A$. Consider the case where $p$ is a limit point of $A$. Then $p$
          is in the closure of $A$. If $p$ is in the closure of $X-A$ then $p \in
          \partial A$ which is a contradiction. Thus, assume $p \notin \overline{X-A}$. 
          Then there exists some open neighborhood $V$ of $p$ such that 
          $V \cap (X-A) = \varnothing$ or equivalently $V \subset A$. Then we have 
          $p \in V \subset A$ which means $p$ is an interior point, $p \in A^\circ$. This 
          is a contradiction. Then $p$ cannot be a limit point of $A$ so assume $p$ is 
          an isolated point of $A$. For the sake of contradiction suppose $p$ is not a limit 
          point of $X-A$. Then there exists an open neighborhood $V$ of $p$ such that 
          $(V-\{p\}) \cap X-A = \varnothing$. In particular, $V \cap X-A = \varnothing$ since 
          $p \in A$. Then $V \subset A$. Then $p \in V \subset A$. Then $p \in A^\circ$. 
          This is a contradiction so $p$ is a limit point of $X-A$. Hence, 
          $p \in \overline{A} \cap \overline{X-A} = \partial A$. Once more, this is a 
          contradiction. Therefore, $p$ cannot be in $A$ since assuming $p \in A$ leads 
          to contradictions. Using the facts that $p \notin \partial A$ and $p \notin 
          (X-A)^\circ$, we can use an analogous argument to show $p \notin X-A$. If 
          $p \notin A$ and $p \notin X-A$, then $p \notin X$.  
          
          Then there exists some open neighborhood $W$ of $p$ 
          such that $(W-\{p\}) \cap A = \varnothing$. Then $(W-\{p\}) \subset X-A$.

          A <strong>sequence</strong> in a topological space $X$ is a function

          We prove the reverse direction first. Let $\mathcal{B}$ be a collection of 
          subsets of $X$ such that properties (1) and (2) hold. We show that $\mathcal{B}$
          is the basis for some topology on $X$. Specifically, we construct a topology, $\tau$ on $X$
          and show $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for $\tau$. Now define we define $\tau$: a 
          set $U$ is in $\tau$ if and only if $U$ is a union of elements in $\mathcal{B}$
          or is the empty set $\varnothing$. Now we verify $\tau$ is in fact a topology 
          on $X$. By definition of $\tau$, $\varnothing \in \tau$. Now we show $X \in \tau$. 
          By the first property of $\mathcal{B}$, for every point $p \in X$ there exists 
          an element $B_p \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $p \in B_p$. Then $X = \cup_{p \in X}B_p$. 
          This is a union of elements in $\mathcal{B}$ so $X$ is in fact open. Let 
          $U$ and $V$ be open sets. We show $U \cap V$ is also open. Since $U$ and $V$ are 
          open let $U = \cup_{C \in \mathcal{B}_1}C$ and $V = \cup_{D \in \mathcal{B}_2}D$ 
          where $\mathcal{B}_1,\mathcal{B}_2 \subset \mathcal{B}$. Let $p \in U \cap V$. 
          Then $p \in (\cup_{C \in \mathcal{B}_1}C) \bigcap (\cup_{D \in \mathcal{B}_2}D)$.
          Then $p \in C$ for some $C \in \mathcal{B}_1 \subset \mathcal{B}$ and 
          $p \in D$ for some $D \in \mathcal{B}_2 \subset \mathcal{B}$. Then by 
          the second property of $\mathcal{B}$, there a set $W_p \in \mathcal{B}$ such that 
          $p \in W_p \subset C \cap D$. In particular, $p \in W_p \subset U \cap V$. 
          Take $W = \cup_{p \in U \cap V} W_p$. Now we show $W = U \cap V$. If $p \in W$
          then $p \in W_q$ for some $q \in U \cap V$. Moreover, $W_q \subset U \cap V$. 
          Thus $p \in U \cap V$ and hence $W \subset U \cap V$. Let $p \in U \cap V$. Then 
          there is an associated $W_p$ such that $p \in W_p \subset \cup_{q \in U\cap V}W_q = W$. 
          Hence, $p \in W$ and $U \cap V \subset W$. Then $U\cap V = W$. Furthermore, $W$
          is a union of elements in $\mathcal{B}$ so $W$ is open in $\tau$. Thus, $U \cap V$
          must be in $\tau$. Suppose we have an arbitrary collection of sets 
          $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in \lambda}$ such that $U_\alpha \in \tau$ for all 
          $\alpha \in \lambda$. Then $\cup_{\alpha \in \lambda}U_\alpha$ is in $\tau$
          since each $U_\alpha$ is a union of sets in $\mathcal{B}$. It follows $\tau$ is 
          in fact a topology on $X$. Moreover, $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for $\tau$ since 
          by definition every set in $\tau$ is a union of elements in $\mathcal{B}$.
          <br><br>
          Now we prove the forward direction. We prove property (1) first. Let $\tau$
          be an arbitrary topology on $X$. Then $X = \cup_{B \in \mathcal{B}'}B$ 
          where $\mathcal{B}' \subset \mathcal{B}$. Let $p \in X$. Then 
          $p \in B$ for some $B \in \mathcal{B}' \subset \mathcal{B}$. Hence, the first 
          property holds. Now we prove the second property. Let $U,V \in \mathcal{B}$. 
          Then $U,V \in \tau$. Then $U \cap V \in \tau$ and 
          $U \cap V = \cup_{C \in \mathcal{B}''}C$ where $\mathcal{B}'' \subset \mathcal{B}$.
           Let $p \in U \cap V$. Then $p \in C$ for some $C \in \mathcal{B}'' \subset \mathcal{B}$.
           Therefore property (2) holds.

          For parts (1) and (2), all subsets of the x-axis are closed. Now 
          we prove part (3). Since $A$ is countable let $A = \cup_{i\in\mathbb{N}} 
          (a_i,0)$ and let $z = (x,0)$. Now let $V = B((x,0),r)\cup \{(x,0)\}$ and 
          then $z \in V$. 
          Moreover, let for all $i\in\mathbb{N}$ let 
          \[U_i = B((a_i,r_i),r_i) \cup \{(a_i,0)\}\]
          where $r_i = (x-a_i)^2/(4r)$
          Then let $U = \cup_{i\in\mathbb{N}} U_i$. It follows 
          $A \subset U$ and we also know $z \in V$. Now we show $U \cap V = \varnothing$. 
          For the sake of contradiction let $(c,d) \in U \cap V$. Then $(c,d)
          \in U_i \cap V$ for some $i$. Then $(c,d) \in B((a_i,r_i),r_i)$ and 
          $(c,d) \in B((x,r),r)$. Then we have $d((c,d),(a_i,r_i)) \lt r_i$ and 
          $d((c,d),(x,r)) \lt r$. Then by the triangle inequality we have
          $d((a_i,r_i),(x,r)) \lt r_i + r$. Note the distance function here is 
          defined as $d \colon \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ as 
          $d(x,y) = (x^2+y^2)^{1/2}$. Then we have 
          \[\sqrt{(x-a_i)^2 + (r_i-r)^2} \lt (x-a_i)^2/(4r) + r\] 
          Then this inequality results in 
          \[r_i \lt (x-a_i)^2/(4r)\]
          But $r_i = (x-a_i)^2/(4r)$. This is a contradiction. Hence $U \cap V = \varnothing$. 
          <br><br>
          Now we prove part (4). Let $A$ and $C$ be disjoint countable sets on the 
          x-axis. Let $A = \cup_{i\in\mathbb{N}} (a_i,0)$ and $C = \cup_{i\in\mathbb{N}} (c_i,0)$.
          Then define $D = \cup_{i\in\mathbb{N}}(d_i,0)$ where 
          \[d_i = \begin{cases} 
          a_{i/2} & i \equiv 0 \pmod{2}\\
          c_{(i+1)/2} & i \equiv 1 \pmod{2}
          \end{cases}\]
          Now we define $W_i$ such that $W_i \in \tau$, $d_i \in W_i$, and $i \ne j$
          implies $W_i \cap W_j = \varnothing$. We construct $W_i$ recursively. 
          First let $W_1 = B((d_1,r_1),r_1) \cup \{(d_1,0)\}$ and take $r_1 > 0$. 
          Now given we constructed $W_1,W_2,\dots,W_{n-1}$, we construct $W_n$. 
          Let the set $R$ be defined as 
          \[R = \{\frac{1}{4r_i}(d_i-d_n)^2 \mid i = 1,2,\dots,n-1\}\]
          Take $r_n = \min R$ which is well-defined since $R$ is finite. 
          Then let $W_n = B((d_n,r_n),r_n)\cup\{(d_n,0)\}$. All that is 
          left to show is if $i \ne j$ then $W_i \cap W_j = \varnothing$. The 
          argument is analogous to part (3): by contradiction suppose there is 
          a point $p$ in the intersection which leads to a contradiction by 
          the triangle inequality.

          Show that the product topology on $X \times Y$ is the same as the topology

        <div class="proof">
          Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of all finite intersections of elements in the 
          proposed subbasis $S$. Let us denote the topology generated by $S$ as $\tau_S$.
          We first show every open set in $X\times Y$ is an open in $\tau_S$. Let $W$ be an open set in $X \times Y$. Then 
          $W = \cup_{\alpha \in \lambda} U_\alpha \times V_\alpha$ where 
          $U_\alpha \in \tau_X$ and $V_\alpha \in \tau_Y$. Note that 
          $U_\alpha \times V_\alpha = \pi_X^{-1}(U_\alpha) \cap \pi_Y^{-1}(V_\alpha)$
          Then $U_\alpha \times V_\alpha \in \mathcal{B}$ for all $\alpha \in \lambda$. 
          It follows $W \in \tau_S$. Now we show every open 
          set in $\tau_S$ is open in $X \times Y$. 
          Note that 
          \[\{\pi_X^{-1}(U) \mid U \in \tau_X\} 
          \cup \{\pi_Y^{-1}(V) \mid V \in \tau_Y\} 
          = \{U\times Y \mid U \in \tau_X\} \cup \{X \times V \mid V \in \tau_Y\}\]
          Then every element in $S$ is open in the product topology. Since $\mathcal{B}$
          is the set of finite intersections of elements in $S$ all elements of $\mathcal{B}$
          are $X \times Y$. Since an open set in $X\times Y$ is open in $\tau_S$ and 
          vice versa, it follows these topologies are in fact the same.

          We prove part (1). Certainly $\inf \{d(a,p) \mid a \in A\}$ is non-negative 
          since the distance function must be non-negative. For the sake of 
          contradiction suppose $\inf \{d(a,p) \mid a \in A\} = 0$. Then 
          let $U$ be an open neighborhood of $p$. Then for some $\varepsilon > 0$ we 
          have $B(p,\varepsilon) \subset U$. Then there exist $a \in A$ such that 
          $d(a,p) < \varepsilon$ otherwise $\inf \{d(a,p) \mid a \in A\} \geq \varepsilon$. 
          It follows $(U-\{p\}) \cap A \ne \varnothing$. Then $p$ is a limit point of $A$.

          Now we prove part (2). Let $X = \mathbb{R}^2$, $p \in X$, and $A$ a closed subset 
          of $X$ that does not contain $p$. Then let $\delta = \inf \{d(a,p) \mid a \in A\}$. 
          By part (1) $\delta > 0$. Take $U = B(p,\delta/2)$ and 
          $V = \{x \mid d(p,x) > \delta/2\}$. Then $p \in U$, $A \subset V$, and 
          $U \cap V = \varnothing$.

          Let $A, C$ be closed subsets of $\mathbb{R}^2$ with the standard topology. 
          Then define the maps $d_A \colon A \to \mathbb{R}$ and $d_C \colon C \to 
          \mathbb{R}$ as 
          \[d_A(a) = \inf \{d(a,c) \mid c \in C\}\]
          \[d_C(c) = \inf \{d(a,c) \mid a \in A\}\]

          $C \subset \bigcup_{c \in C} B(c,d_C(c)) = V$. 
          Now we show $U \cap V = \varnothing$. For the sake of contradiction suppose 
          $p \in U \cap V$. Then $p \in B(a,d_A(a)/2)$ and $p \in B(c,d_C(c)/2)$ for some 
          $a \in A$ and $c \in C$. Then we have 
          $d(a,p) < d_A(a)/2$ and $d(p,c) < d_C(c)/2$. Then by the triangle inequality 
          we have $d(a,c) < d_A(a)/2 + d_C(c)/2$. Note $d_A(a)/2 \leq d(a,c)/2$ and 
          $d_C(c)/2 \leq d(a,c)/2$. The altogether we have
          \[d(a,c) < d_A(a)/2 + d_C(c)/2 \leq d(a,c)\]
          This is a contradiction. Hence, $U \cap V = \varnothing$. Hence, $\mathbb{R}^2$
          is normal.

          $b \in V_1$, $d \in V_2$, and $V_1 \cap V_2 = \varnothing$. There 
          exists an open set in $\tau_X$ such that $a,c \in U$. For example,

          there exist sets $U' \in \tau_X$ and $V' \in \tau_Y$ such that 
          $a \in U'$, $b \in V'$, $\overline{U'} \subset U$, and $\overline{V'} \subset V$.

          Suppose $(c,d)$ is a limit point of $U' \times V'$. Then 
          for all open sets $F$ in $X \times Y$ we have 
          \[(F - \{(c,d)\}) \cap (U' \times V') \ne \varnothing\]
          where $F = \cup_{\beta \in \Lambda} G_\beta \times H_\beta$ and

          Let $X$ be regular and $Y \subset X$. We show $Y$ is regular. 
          Let $p \in Y$ and $U \in \tau_Y$ such that $p \in U$. Then

          Now suppose $q$ is a limit point of $V$ in the subspace topology. 
          Then for every open neighborhood $W$ of $q$ in $Y$ we have

          We contruct two new collections of open sets $\{U_i'\}$ and 
          $\{V_i'\}$ recursively and show their unions are disjoint and 
          are open covers of $A$ and $B$ respectively. Moreover, our goal 
          is for every point covered in $A$ by $U_i$ that $U_i'$ also contains
          those points and same goes for $V_i'$. However, the additional 
          constraint is $U_i'$ is disjoint from $V_1,V_2,\dots,V_{i-1}$ and 
          $V_j'$ is disjoint from $U_1,U_2,\dots,U_j$. 
          Let $U_1' = U_1$. Now

          $p \in X - \cup_{i=1}^1\overline{U_i'}$ and $p \in V_1$. These are both 
          open sets so their intersection is open and contains $p$. Then

          $W_{1,p} \subset (X-\cup_{i=1}^1\overline{U_i'})$ and $W_{1,p} \subset 
          V_1$. Take $V_1' = \cup_{p \in V_1 \cap B} W_{1,p}$. Note $V_1'$ is open,

          as follows. Let $p \in U_n \cap A$. Since $\overline{V_i'} \cap A = 
          \varnothing$ for all $i$ we have 
          $(\cup_{i=1}^{n-1}\overline{V_i'}) \cap A = \varnothing$. 
          Then $A \subset X-\cup_{i=1}^{n-1}\overline{V_i'}$. It follows 
          $p \in X-\cup_{i=1}^{n-1}\overline{V_i'}$ and $p \in U_n$. Since 
          both of these sets are open their intersection is open. 
          Then there exists an open set $T_{n,p}$ such that 
          $T_{n,p} \subset \cup_{i=1}^{n-1}\overline{V_i'}$ and 
          $T_{n,p} \subset U_n$. Then take $U_n' = \cup_{p \in U_n \cap A} T_{n,p}$. 
          Note that $\overline{U_n'} \cap B = \varnothing$ since $U_n' \subset U_n$

          $W_{n,p} \subset V_n$. 
          Then take $V_n' = \cup_{p \in V_n \cap B} W_{n,p}$. Note 
          $\overline{V_n'} \cap A = \varnothing$ and $V_n'$ is open.

          Take $U = \cup_{i\in\mathbb{N}}U_i'$ and $V = \cup_{i\in\mathbb{N}}V_i'$. 
          By nature of construction $U$ and $V$ are both open since arbitrary unions 
          of open sets are open.
          Now we show $A\subset U$. Let $p \in A$. Then $p \in U_i$ for some $i$. 
          Note $U_i' = \cup_{q \in U_i \cap A} T_{i,q}$ so then 
          $p \in T_{i,p} \subset U_i'$. Hence, $p \in U_i'$ and $A \subset U$. 
          An analogous argument shows $B \subset V$. Now we show $U \cap V = \varnothing$. 
          For the sake of contradiction let $p \in U \cap V$. Then 
          $p \in U_i' \cap V_j'$ for some $i,j$. Suppose $j \geq i$. Then 
          note $V_j \subset X - \cup_{k=1}^j \overline{U_k'}$. Then 
          $V_j' \cap U_i' = \varnothing$. This contradicts $p \in V_j' \cap U_i'$. 
          Now suppose $j \lt i$. Then note $U_i' \subset X-\cup_{k=1}^{i-1}\overline{V_k'}$.
          Then $U_i' \cap V_j' = \varnothing$ which contradicts $p \in U_i' \cap V_j'$.

          We prove the forward direction first. Let $\{B_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in \lambda}$

          there is a countable subcover. Then $X \subset B_{\alpha_1} \cup B_{\alpha_2}

          Note that $p \notin \overline{W_{\beta_i}}$ and $G_i$ remains open

          Now we show $X$ is normal. Let $A$ and $B$ be two disjoint closed subsets

          exist two disjoint open sets $U_p$ and $V_p$ such that $p \in U_p$

          Then $\mathcal{U}$ is a cover of $X$. Since $X$ is paracompact, 
          there is a locally finite open refinement 
          $\mathcal{W} = \{W_\beta\}_{\beta \in \mu}$ of $\mathcal{U}$.
          Note that the only element in $\mathcal{U}$ that intersects $B$ 
          is $X-A$. And since $\mathcal{W}$ is an open cover of $X$, 
          there is some $W_{\beta_0}$ such that $W_{\beta_0} \subset X-A$. It 
          follows $W_{\beta_0}$ is the only element of $\mathcal{W}$ that 
          has a non-empty intersection with $B$. Then $W_{\beta_0}$ contains $B$.
          Furthermore take $W' = \cup_{\beta \in \mu-\{\beta_0\}}W_\beta$ 
          and then $A \subset W'$.  
          By paracompactness of $X$, for every point $q \in B$ there 
          exist open set $T_q$ such that $T_q$ intersects finitely 
          many elements of $\mathcal{W}$, say

          $T_q'$ by constructing $T_0,T_1,\dots,T_{n_q}$. 
          Take $T_0 = T_q$. For $i=1,2,\dots,n_q$, if $W_{\beta_i} = W_{\beta_0}$
          then $T_i = T_{i-1}$ otherwise $T_i = T_{i-1} - \overline{W}_{\beta_i}$. 
          Then take $T_q' = T_n$. Note that $\overline{W}_{\beta} \cap B = \varnothing$ 
          for all $\beta \in \mu$
          so then $q \in T_q'$. Moreover, $T_q'$ is open and $T_q' \cap 
          W' = \varnothing$. Take $T' = \cup_{q \in B}T_q'$. 
          Then $T'$ is open, $B \subset T'$, and $T' \cap W' = \varnothing$. 
          Moreover, $W'$ is open and $A \subset W'$. It follows $W'$ and

        <div class="proof">
          We first show (1) implies (2). Let $K$ be closed in $Y$. Then 
          $Y-K$ is open. Then $f^{-1}(Y-K)$ is open in $X$. Now we show 
          $f^{-1}(Y-K) = X - f^{-1}(K)$. Let $p \in f^{-1}(Y-K)$. Then 
          $f(p) \in Y-K$. Then $p \in X - f^{-1}(K)$. Since $X - f^{-1}(K)$ 
          is open it follows $f^{-1}(K)$ is closed.
          <br><br>
          Now we show (2) implies (3). Let $p$ be a limit point of $A$. 
          If $p \in A$ then $f(p) \in \overline{f(A)}$. Now suppose 
          $p \notin A$. For the sake of contradiction suppose 
          $f(p) \notin \overline{f(A)}$. 
          Then $p \in X - f^{-1}(\overline{A})$. Note $X - f^{-1}(\overline{A})$ is 
          open by part (2). Then there is some open neighborhood $U$ of $p$ 
          such that $U \subset X - f^{-1}(\overline{A})$. Moreover, 
          $p$ is a limit point of $A$ so then 
          $(U - \{p\}) \cap A \ne \varnothing$. 
          Let $a \in (U-\{p\}) \cap A$. Then 
          $a \in f^{-1}(\overline{f(A)})$. But $a \in U \subset X - 
          f^{-1}(\overline{f(A)})$. This is a contradiction. Hence, 
          $f(p) \in \overline{f(A)}$. 
          <br><br>
          Now we show (3) implies (4). Let $x \in X$ and $V$ be an open set 
          that contains $f(x)$. For the sake of contradiction suppose 
          for every open set $U$ containing $x$ we have $f(U) \cap (X-V) 
          \ne \varnothing$. Then $(U-\{x\}) \cap f^{-1}(X-V) \ne \varnothing$. 
          Then $x$ is a limit point of $f^{-1}(X-V)$. 
          Then by part (3) we have $f(x)$ belonging to $\overline{X-V}$
          and since $X-V$ is closed $\overline{X-V} = X-V$. 
          Then $f(x) \in X-V$ and $f(x) \in V$. This is a contradiction. 
          Hence, there is an open set $U$ containing $x$ such that 
          $f(U) \subset V$. 
          <br><br>
          Now we show part (4) implies part (1). Let $V$ be an open set 
          in $Y$. Then we show $f^{-1}(V)$ is open. If $f(X) \cap V = \varnothing$ 
          then $f^{-1}(V) = \varnothing$ which is open. Now suppose 
          $V \cap f(X) \ne \varnothing$. Then let $p \in f^{-1}(V)$. 
          Then by part (4) there is an open neighborhood $U_p$ of $p$ such that 
          $f(U) \subset V$. Then consider the set $W = \cup_{p \in f^{-1}(V)} U_p$. 
          This is a union of open sets which is open. 
          Now we show $W = f^{-1}(V)$. Let $p \in W$. Then $p \in U_q$ for 
          some $q \in f^{-1}(V)$. Moreover, $f(U_q) \subset V$. Hence, 
          $p \in f^{-1}(V)$. It follows $W \subset f^{-1}(V)$. Now let 
          $x \in f^{-1}(V)$. Then $x \in U_x \subset W$. It follows 
          $W = f^{-1}(V)$. Since $W$ is open it follows $f^{-1}(V)$ is open.

          We first use the definition a continuous function. Let $V$ be an

          We use the 2nd alternative definition of a continuous function.

          Now suppose $y_0 \notin K$. Then $f^{-1}(K) = \varnothing$ which 
          is also closed. Hence, $f$ is continuous.

          Consider the third definition. Let $A \subset X$ and let 
          $p$ be a limit point of $A$. Then we show $f(p) \in 
          \overline{f(A)}$. Note that $f(A) = y_0$ and $f(p) = y_0$. 
          Hence, $f(p) \in f(A)$. It follows $f$ is continuous.

          Consider the fourth definition. Let $p \in X$ and let 
          $V$ be an open set in $Y$ such that $f(p) \in V$. 
          Then take $U = X$. Then $U$ is an open set in $X$ that 
          contains $p$ and $f(U) = \{y_0\} \subset V$. Hence, 
          $f$ is continuous.
