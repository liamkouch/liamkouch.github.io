        </div>
        <div class="proof">
          We prove by inducting on $n$. The base case for $n = 1$ is trivially true.
          For the inductive hypothesis assume $P(m)$ is true where $P(m)$ denotes
          the theorem statement for $n = m$. We show $P(m+1)$ is true. Now suppose we 
          a collection of $m+1$ open sets, $\{U_i\}_{i=1}^{m+1}$. By the hypothesis
          it follows $\cap_{i=1}^m U_i$ is open. Since the intersection of two open
          sets is an open set we have $(\cap_{i=1}^m U_i) \cap U_{m+1} \in \tau$. Hence,
          $\cap_{i=1}^{m+1} U_i \in \tau$. This concludes the induction.

          Why does your proof not prove the false statement that the infinite 
          intersection of open sets is necessarily open?
        </div>
        The above proof only shows that a finite intersection is open. Counterexample: 
        consider $\tau_\text{std}$ on $\mathbb{R}$. Then the intersection over the 
        collection $\{I_i\}_{i=1}^n$ where $I_j = (-1/j,1/j)$ is just $\{0\}$. However,
        this is not open. 
        <div class="theorem">
          A set $U$ is open in a topological space $(X,\tau)$ if and only if for 
          every point $x \in U$, there exists an open set $U_x$ such that
          $x \in U_x \subset U$.
        </div>
        <div class="proof">
          For the forward direction take $U_x = U$. For the reverse direction
          consider $\cup_{x \in U} U_x$ and note it is open since it is a union 
          of open sets. We show $U = \cup_{x \in U} U_x$. First we show
          $U \subset \cup_{x \in U} U_x$. Let $p \in U$. Then there exists 
          a corresponding $U_p$. Then $p \in U_p \subset \cup_{x \in U} U_x$.
          Hence, $U \subset \cup_{x \in U} U_x$. Now we show
          $U \supset \cup_{x \in U} U_x$. Let $q \in \cup_{x \in U} U_x$. Then
          $q \in U_x$ for some $x \in U$. Moreover, $U_x \subset U$ for any
          $x$. Hence, $q \in U_x \subset U$. Therefore, 
          $U \supset \cup_{x \in U} U_x$. It follows $U = \cup_{x \in U} U_x$.
          Furthermore, we know the right side is open so then $U$ must also be
          open.

          In $\mathbb{R}^n$, the <strong>Euclidean distance</strong> between 
          points $x = (x_1,\dots,x_n)$ and $y=(y_1,\dots,y_n)$ is defined as
          \[d(x,y) = (\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-y_i)^2)^{1/2}\]

          Then an <strong>open ball</strong> of radius $\varepsilon > 0$ around
          point $p \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is the set
          \[B(p,\varepsilon) = \{x \mid d(p,x) < \varepsilon\}\]
          Moreover, the <stong>standard topology</strong> $\tau_{\text{std}}$ on 
          $\mathbb{R}^n$ is defined as follows: a subset $U$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$
          belongs to $\tau_{\text{std}}$ if and only if for each point $p$ of
          $U$ there is an $\varepsilon_p > 0$ such that $B(p,\varepsilon_p)
          \subset U$.
        </div>
        <div class="exercise">
          The $\tau_{\text{std}}$ is a topology on $\mathbb{R}^n$.
        </div>
     
        <div class="proof">
          The empty set is open vacuously. For whole set $\mathbb{R}^n$ consider 
          any point $p \in \mathbb{R}^n$. Then we can take the ball $B(p,1)$. Then 
          $p \in B(p,1) \subset \mathbb{R}^n$. It follows the whole set is open.
          Now consider two open sets $U$ and $V$. Consider a point $p$ in their 
          intersection $U \cap V$. Since $U$ and $V$ are open and $p \in U$ and
          $p \in V$ there exists $r_u,r_v > 0$ such that $B(p,r_u) \subset U$ and 
          $B(p,r_v) \subset V$. Take $r = \min\{r_u,r_v\}$. Then $B(p,r) \subset U$
          and $B(p,r)\subset V$. Hence, $B(p,r) \subset U \cap V$. Now consider a
          collection of open sets $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in \lambda}$. Take a point 
          $p \in \cup_{\alpha \in \lambda} U_\alpha$. 
          Then $p \in U_\beta$ for some $\beta \in \lambda$. Since $U_\beta$ is open we have 
          $p \in B(p,r) \subset \cup_{\alpha \in \lambda} U_\alpha$ for some $r > 0$. 
          Hence, the union over the collection 
          $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in \lambda}$ is open. It follows $\tau_\text{std}$ is a topology.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
          Given a set $X$, let $\tau = 2^X$, the set of all subsets of $X$. This topology 
          $\tau$ is called the <strong>discrete topology</strong> on $X$. We call the 
          space $(X,2^X)$ a <strong>discrete topological space</strong>. 
        </div>

        <div class="example">
          Given a set $X$, the collection $\tau = \{\varnothing, X\}$ is called the 
          <strong>indiscrete topology</strong> on $X$. We call the space 
          $(X, \{\varnothing,X\})$ an <strong>indiscrete topological space</strong>. 
          In this space, there are only two open sets: the empty set and the entire set 
          $X$.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
          Given a set $X$, the <strong>finite complement</strong> of cofinite topology 
          on $X$ is described as follows: a subset $U$ of $X$ is open if and only if 
          $X-U$ is finite or $U = \varnothing$.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
          Given a set $X$, the <strong>countable complement</strong> or cocountable topology on $X$ 
          is described as follows: a subset $U$ of $X$ is open if and only if $X-U$ is 
          countable or $U = \varnothing$.
        </div>
        
        <div class = "exercise">
          Verify that the discrete, indiscrete, finite complement, and countable complement 
          topologies are indeed topologies for any set $X$.
        </div>
        <div class="proof">
          We first verify the discrete topology. Since every subset of $X$ is open, 
          $\varnothing$ and $X$ itself are open. If $U$ and $V$ are open sets. Then their
          intersection is another subset of $X$. Hence, $U \cap V$ is open. Moreover, an 
          arbitrary union of open sets is a subset of $X$ so then the union must also be 
          open. It follows the discrete topology is in fact a topology.
          <br><br>
          Second we verify the indiscrete topology. By definition $\varnothing$ and $X$ 
          are open. Since these are the only two sets, there is only one intersection to 
          consider, $\varnothing \cap X = \varnothing$. Hence, open sets are closed under 
          intersection. Consider an arbitrary collection of open sets $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in \lambda}$.
          If for all $\alpha \in \lambda$, $U_\alpha = \varnothing$, then the union over
          the collection is $\varnothing$. Otherwise if for some $\alpha \in \lambda$ we have
          $U_\alpha = X$, then the union of the collection is $X$. In either case, the union 
          over the collection is open. It follows the indiscrete topology is indeed a topology.
          <br><br>
          Third, we verify the cofinite topoology. By definition the empty set is open. 
          Since $X - X = \varnothing$ which is finite, it follows $X$ is open. Now consider 
          two open sets $U$ and $V$. Then consider $X - (U \cap V)$. By De Morgan's law 
          we have $(X - U) \cup (X - V)$. We know $X-U$ and $X-V$ are finite and the union 
          of two finite sets is finite. Hence, $U \cap V$ is open. Now consider the arbitrary 
          collection of open sets $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in \lambda}$. Consider $X-\cup_{\alpha \in \lambda} U_\alpha$. 
          This equates to $\cap_{\alpha \in \lambda} (X - U_\alpha)$. We know $X - U_\beta$
          for some $\beta \in \lambda$ is finite and $\cap_{\alpha \in \lambda} (X - U_\alpha) \subset X-\beta$. 
          It follows $\cap_{\alpha \in \lambda} (X - U_\alpha)$ is finite. Hence, the arbitrary 
          collection of open sets is in fact open. Therefore, the confinite topology is a topology.
          <br><br>
          Lastly, we verify the cocountable topology. By definition the empty set is again 
          open. $X-X = \varnothing$ which is finite implying countable. Since the union of 
          two countable sets is countable, it follows if $X-V$ and $X-U$ are countable, their 
          intersection is as well. Consider the arbitrary collection of open sets $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in \lambda}$. 
          Then consider $X - \cup_{\alpha \in \lambda}U_\alpha$. This is equivalent to 
          $\cap_{\alpha \in \lambda} (X-U_\alpha)$. This is at most countable. Hence, the

        We construct a case for the cofinite topology on $\mathbb{R}$. 
        For $i \in \mathbb{N}$ define $U_i = \mathbb{R} - \{1,\dots,i\}$. Each of 
        these sets is open in the cofinite topology. We show the infinite intersection 
        over these sets is not open.
        \[\mathbb{R}-\bigcap_{i \in \mathbb{N}} U_i = \bigcup_{i \in \mathbb{N}} (\mathbb{R}-U_i)
        = \bigcup_{i \in \mathbb{N}} \{1,2,\dots,i\} = \mathbb{N}\]
        The complement of the infinite intersection is not finite, so not open.

        Now we construct a case for the cocountable topology on $\mathbb{R}$. 
        We define a collection of sets as follows: for $\alpha \in

        \[U_\alpha = \left\{\alpha + x \mid x \in \mathbb{R}-\mathbb{N}\right\}\]

        \[\mathbb{R} - \bigcap_{\alpha \in \left[0,1\right)} U_\alpha = 
        \bigcup_{\alpha \in \left[0,1\right)} (\mathbb{R}-U_\alpha) = \left[1,\infty\right)\]
        The complement of the infinite intersection is not countable, hence not open.

          For any topological space $(X,\tau)$ and $A \subset X$, the set $\overline{A}$ 
          is closed. That is, for any set $A$ in a topological space, $\overline{\overline{A}} = \overline{A}$.

        <div class="proof">
          We show that $\overline{A}$ contains all its limit points. Let $p$ be a limit point 
          of $\overline{A}$. If $p \in A$ then $p \in \overline{A}$. Thus, we assume 
          $p \notin A$. Now to prove $p \in \overline{A}$ it is sufficient to show $p$ is 
          a limit point of $A$ which is what we prove. Since $p$ is a limit point of $\overline{A}$, 
          by definition we have $(U-\{p\}) \cap \overline{A} \ne \varnothing$ for any open 
          neighborhood $U$ of $p$. Let $q$ be in this intersection. There are two cases. If 
          $q \in A$ then we are done. Now consider the case where $q$ is a limit point of $A$.
          Since $U$ is also an open neighborhood of $q$ and $q$ is a limit point of $A$, it follows 
          $(U-\{q\} \cap A \ne \varnothing)$. Note $p$ is not in this intersection since we 
          assumed $p \notin A$. Then $(U-\{p\}) \cap A \ne \varnothing$. Hence, $p$ is a limit 
          point of $A$. Then, $p \in \overline{A}$. Therefore, $\overline{A}$ is closed.

        <div class="proof">
          We prove the forward direction first. Let $p \in X-A$. Since $A$ is closed, $p$ 
          is not in $A$ and is not a limit point of $A$. Then there exists an open neighborhood $U$
          of $p$ such that $U \cap A = \varnothing$. Then $U \subset X-A$. Altogether, we have
          $p \in U \subset X-A$. Hence, by Theorem 2.3 $X-A$ is open. Now we prove the 
          reverse direction. Say $X-A$ is open. We show $A$ is closed. Let $q$ be a limit point 
          of $A$. Then for every open neighborhood $V$ of $q$, $(V-\{q\}) \cap A \ne \varnothing$. 
          For the sake of contradiction suppose $p \in X-A$. Since, $X-A$ is open, there exists 
          some open neighborhood $W$ of $p$ such that $p \in W \subset X-A$. Then 
          $(W-\{p\}) \cap A = \varnothing$. But this contradicts $p$ being a limit point of $A$.
          Hence, $p$ must be in $A$. Thus $A$ is closed.

          $X-(A-U) = (X-A) \cup U$ is open. We know $X-A$ and $U$ are open so their union

          respectively. Suppose we have a finite union of closed sets

          The complement of this finite union is the finite intersection $\cap_{i=1}^n (X-U_i)$.
          This is a finite intersection of open sets. This is open. Hence, the finite union

          To show the intersection over the collection is closed we show the complement is open.
          The complement of the intersection is the union $\bigcup_{\alpha \in \lambda} (X-A_\alpha)$.

          \[C_n = I_n^1 \cup I_n^2 \cup I_n^3 \cup \cdots \cup I_n^{2^n}\]
          
          Where if $j < k$ then $x < y$ for all $x \in I_i^j, y \in I_i^k$ 
          for all $j,k \in \{1,2,3,...,2^i\}$ and all $i \in \mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$. 
          Then the cantor set is defined to be $C = \cap_{i=1}^\infty C_i$. We now show 
          $C$ is a subset of the interval $\left[0,1\right]$, closed, contains no non-empty 
          open interval, and no point of $C$ is an isolated point.

          Since  $\left[0,1\right]  \supset C_0 \supset C_1  \supset \cdots$ it follows $C 
          \subset \left[0,1\right]$. Moreover, $C$ is an infinite intersection of closed 
          sets which is closed by Theorem 2.16. Now we show that $C$ contains no non-empty 
          open interval. For sake of contradiction, suppose that $C$ contains a non-empty open 
          interval $(s,t)$ where $s < t$ and $s,t \in \mathbb{R}$.

          Let $P(n)$ be the statement "Let $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$ and $a < b$. 
          If $(a,b) \subset C_n$ then $|a-b| \leq 1/3^n$ for some non-negative 
          integer $n$." We show that $p(n)$ is true for all $n \geq 0$ by induction. 
          For the base case, consider $n=0$. Then suppose $(a,b) \subset C_0 = 
          \left[0,1\right]$. Then we have $0 \leq a < b \leq 1$. It follows $|a-b| 
          \leq 1 = 1/3^0$. It follows $P(0)$ is true. 

          Now we move on to the inductive step. For the inductive hypothesis 
          we assume $P(m)$ is true. Now assume $(a,b) \subset C_{m+1}$. Since 
          $C_{m+1} \subset C_m$ it follows $(a,b) \subset C_m$. Then $C_m$ has 
          $2^m$ disjoint closed intervals.
          \[C_m = I_m^1 \cup I_m^2 \cup I_m^3 \cup \cdots \cup I_m^{2^m}\]
          where $I_w^z$ is the zth closed interval for $C_w$. It follows $(a,b)$ 
          is in exactly one of these intervals. Then let $(a,b) = I_m^k$ for some 
          $k \in \{1,2,...,2^m\}$. Then $I_m^k=\left[c,d\right]$ where $c,d \in 
          \mathbb{R}$. Since $(a,b)\subset\left[c,d\right]$ we have $c \leq a < b 
          \leq d$. It follows $|a-b|\leq d-c$. For the sake of contradiction 
          suppose $d-c>1/3^m$. Then there exists $p,q\in\mathbb{R}$ such that 
          $(p,q) \subset C_m$ and $|p-q| > 1/3^m$; however, since $(p,q) \subset 
          C_m$ we must have $|p-q| \leq 1/3^m$ by the inductive hypothesis. This 
          is a contradiction. It follows $d-c\leq 1/3^m$. 

          Since $(a,b)\subset \left[c,d\right] \subset C_m$ and by assumption 
          $(a,b)\subset C_{m+1}$, it follows $(a,b)$ falls in the left or right 
          third of $\left[c,d\right]$. Specifically, $(a,b) \subset 
          \left[c,c+\frac{1}{3}(d-c)\right]$ or $(a,b) \subset 
          \left[c+\frac{2}{3}(d-c),d\right]$. Then we have 
          \[c \leq a < b \leq c+\frac{1}{3}(d-c)\]
          or
          \[c + \frac{2}{3}(d-c) \leq a < b \leq d\]
          In either case we have $|a-b| \leq (d-c)/3$. But $d-c \leq 1/3^m$ 
          so then $|a-b| \leq 1/3^{m+1}$. It follows $P(m+1)$ is true. This 
          concludes the induction. Hence, $P(n)$ is true for all $n \geq 0$. 

          We assumed that $(s,t) \subset C$. Then $(s,t) \subset C_m$ for all 
          $m \in \mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$. Since we showed $P(n)$ is true for all 
          $n \in \mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$, it follows $|s-t| \leq 1/3^m$ for all $m$. 
          Suppose $|s-t| > 0$. Then by the archimedean property there exists a 
          sufficiently large $m$ such that $|s-t| > 1/3^m$. It follows $|s-t| = 0$. 
          Moreover $(s,t) \in \left[0,1\right]$ so then $0 < s,t$ which implies $s=t$.
           But this is a contradiction since this implies $(s,t)$ is an empty open 
           interval. Moreover, we assumed $s < t$. Hence, $C$ contains no non-empty 
           open interval.

          Now we show $C$ contains no isolated points. Let $P^*(n)$ be the statement 
          "let $x \in \mathbb{R}$. If $x \in C_n$ there exists $y \in \mathbb{R}$ such 
          that $y\ne x$, $y \in C$, and $|x-y| \leq 1/3^n$ for some non-negative integer
           $n$." We show $P^*(n)$ is true for all non-negative integers. Suppose 
           $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and $x \in C_i$ for some $i \in \mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$.
          Then 
          \[C_i = I_i^1 \cup I_i^2 \cup I_i^3 \cup \cdots \cup I_i^{2^i} \]
          Then $x \in I_i^j$ for some $j \in \{1,2,3,...,2^i\}$. 
          Then $I_i^j = \left[c,d\right]$ where $c,d \in \mathbb{R}$ and $c < d$. 
          Then $c \leq x \leq d$. If $x < d$ then let $y = d$ so then $(x,y) 
          \subset C_i$. Otherwise if $x = d$ then let $y = c$ so then $(y,x) 
          \subset C_i$. In either case, the hypothesis of $P(i)$ (note $P(i)$ 
          not $P^*(i)$) is satisfied so then by the implication of $P(i)$ we have 
          $|x-y| \leq 1/3^i$. Moreover $y \ne x$.

          Now we show $y \in C$. Notice $y =d$ or $y = c$ for $I_i^j$. 
          If suffices to show that if $y$ is an endpoint of some closed 
          interval $I_p^q$ (where $p \in \mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$ and $q \in 
          \{1,2,3,...,2^p\}$), then $y \in C$. 

          Suppose $y$ is an endpoint of some interval in $C_k$ where 
          $k\geq0$. Then 
          \[
          y \in I_k^\ell = \left[c_k^\ell, d_k^\ell \right]
          \]
          for some $\ell \in \{1,2,3,...,2^k\}$ and $c_k^\ell$ and 
          $d_k^\ell$ are the corresponding endpoints. Since $y$ is an 
          endpoint of $I_k^\ell$ we have either $y = c_k^\ell$ or $y = d_k^\ell$.
           If $y = c_k^\ell$ then 
          \[
          y \in I_{k+1}^{2\ell-1} = 
          \left[y,d_{k+1}^{2\ell-1}\right]=\left[y,c_k^\ell+(d_k^\ell-c_k^\ell)/3\right]
          \]
          Then $y = c_{k+1}^{2\ell-1}$. If $y = d_k^\ell$ then 
          \[
          y \in I_{k+1}^{2\ell} = \left[c_{k+1}^{2\ell}, y\right] = 
          \left[c_k^\ell+2(d_k^\ell-c_k^\ell)/3,y\right]
          \]
          Then $y = d_{k+1}^{2\ell}$. It follows $y$ is an endpoint of some interval 
          in $C_{k+1}$. Hence, we have shown if $y$ is an endpoint of some interval
           in $C_k$ then $y$ is an endpoint of some interval in $C_{k+1}$. 

          Recall that we showed that if $x \in C_i$ then there exists $x\ne y \in C_i$
          such $|x-y|\leq 1/3^i$. Moreover, we take $y$ as an endpoint in some closed 
          interval $I_i^j$. It follows $y$ is an endpoint of some interval in $C_i$.
          We have shown that if $y$ is an endpoint of some interval in $C_k$ then $y$
          is an endpoint of some interval in $C_{k+1}$ for all $k\geq 0$. By induction,
          t follows $y$ is an endpoint of $C_m$ and therefore $y \in C_m$ for all 
          $m \geq i$. Moreover, we have $C_0 \supset C_1 \supset \cdots \supset C_i$.
          It follows $y \in C_v$ (but not necessarily an endpoint of) for all 
          $0 \leq v < i$. It follows $y \in C_w$ for all $w \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{0\}$. 
          Thus $y \in C$. It follows $P^*(n)$ is true for all $n \in \mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$.

          Using $P^*(n)$ we show there exists no isolated points in $C$. 
          Let $x \in C$ and suppose we have the open set $U = (x-\epsilon, x+\epsilon)$ 
          where $\epsilon\in\mathbb{R}$ and $\epsilon>0$. Then by the archimedean 
          property there exists a sufficiently large $n \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{0\}$ 
          such that $1/3^n < \epsilon$. Then let $m \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{0\}$ such 
          that $1/3^m < \epsilon$. Since $x \in C$ it follows $x \in C_m$. Then by 
          $P^*(m)$ it follows there exists a $y \in C$ such that $|x-y| \leq 1/3^m < \epsilon$.
           It follows $((x-\epsilon, x+\epsilon) - \{x\}) \cap C \ne \varnothing$ 
           since $y \in ((x-\epsilon, x+\epsilon) - \{x\}) \cap C$ and $y \ne x$. 
           Thus $x$ is a limit point and not an isolated point.

          We have shown the cantor set, denoted as $C$, is a non-empty subset of the
          closed unit interval $\left[0,1\right]$ that is closed, contains no non-empty
          open interval, and no isolated points.
